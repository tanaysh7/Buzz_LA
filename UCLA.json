        "description": "Speaker: Anne B. Clark, Professor of Biological Sciences, Binghamton University\nAnthropogenic change, especially urbanization and climate change, is challenging all organisms, including humans, to adapt. Evolutionary ecologists predict that behaviorally more flexible animals, especially those that learn and transmit information socially, will adapt most successfully. Crows and ravens (Corvus sp.) fit this idea of behaviorally flexible, generalist species with plenty of cognitive capacity; indeed, a number of Corvus species are now well-established in urban areas worldwide.\nBased on her thirty-year study of one population in Ithaca, New York, Clark will introduce the complex social world of American crows, how they do or don't fit the expected \"urban adaptor\" and also how even small cities are dynamic environments that continue to challenge them. Clark will also extend the discussion to crow species globally, the scientific and ecological value of this surprisingly diverse group, and the possibility that many crow species could disappear in the face of complacency and anthropogenic change.\nClark received her PhD in evolutionary biology at the University of Chicago. Her lab researches ecology and evolution of non-human animal social behaviors.\nLight refreshments will be served.\n",

The effects American communities are experiencing today \u2013 heat waves, sea-level rise, extreme rainfall, crop failures, and wildfires \u2013 will worsen over time.\nIn 2015, 21 youth plaintiffs filed suit against the federal government, arguing that by subsidizing fossil fuels and failing to control greenhouse gas emissions the United States is violating the children's constitutional rights to life, liberty, and property. The innovative case, Juliana v. United States, has survived two appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court, but government lawyers continue to fight to prevent the case from ever heading to trial.\nAt an Earth Day event hosted by UCLA School of Law's Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, Julia Olson, Executive Director and Chief Legal Counsel for Our Children's Trust, and lead attorney for the youth plaintiffs, will deliver an evening lecture to discuss this groundbreaking case. Olson's work has been profiled in 60 Minutes, The Washington Post, CNN, Vogue, NPR, and many other leading media outlets. University of Oregon Law Professor Mary Wood told The New York Times, \"she has built not just a case, but a movement.\"\nFollowing the lecture, UCLA Emmett Institute Faculty Director and Shapiro Law Professor Ann Carlson will moderate a discussion and Q&A with the speaker. A reception will precede the event.\nThis event is co-sponsored by UCLA Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, UCLA Sustainability, and the UCLA Sustainable LA Grand Challenge.\n",

        "link": "http://happenings.ucla.edu/all/event/297465",
        "description": "The Sign of the Cross (1932) \nIf one film was responsible for the grassroots movement that ended four years of \u201cimmoral\u201d pre-Code movies, it was not a film starring Mae West or Norma Shearer. It was a film about early Christians. The Sign of the Cross is based on a reverent 1896 play that Cecil B. DeMille had seen as a youth; in 1932, at 50, he wanted to complete the trilogy he had begun with The Ten Commandments (1923) and The King of Kings (1927). He also needed to revive his stalled career, but the odds were against him, as the Great Depression pushed Paramount (which he had co-founded in 1916) into bankruptcy.\nDeMille\u2019s use of symbolism, crowds, crane shots, dialectical montage, contrapuntal sound, music cues, multitrack mixing, and even silence is masterly, surpassing the masterpieces made in 1932 by Ernst Lubitsch, Rouben Mamoulian and Irving Thalberg. The Sign of the Cross has another distinction: it is the most graphically violent and sexually explicit feature yet released by a major studio. \u201cThis is the boldest censor-bait ever attempted in a picture,\u201d wrote Variety. Reports from packed theaters confirmed this. \u201cAt the Rialto,\u201d wrote the New York Times, \u201cwomen put their hands across their eyes to shut out the dreadful views; others fainted.\u201d\n35mm, b/w, 125 min.\nDirector: Cecil B. DeMille\n\nOnly Yesterday (1933) \nOnly Yesterday made a star of an unknown stage actress, Margaret Sullavan, and presented the story of an unwed mother who is both self-determining and unrepentant. And it was one of the first Hollywood features to depict a gay couple, albeit in an incidental manner. Only Yesterday opens with a harrowing depiction of the 1929 stock market crash, the finale of the 1931 book from which Universal borrowed the title. That book treated the 1920s as a distant, regrettable period, the attitude of many pre-Code films, but John Stahl looks at the jazz era with less disdain, basing his film on the wistful Stefan Zweig novel, Letter from an Unknown Woman.\nWhile 1933 had seen a flurry of flagrantly gay characters, Only Yesterday is the only Hollywood film (of its time) to present a gay couple as a matter of fact. Franklin Pangborn is an interior designer who brings his handsome partner (Barry Norton) to a penthouse party. While these characters are supposed to show the decadence of the twenties, they are sympathetically presented.\nOnly Yesterday was a box office success, one of Universal\u2019s few in 1933, but producer Carl Laemmle Jr. had to fight the Studio Relations Committee (the Production Code office) to retain its gay characters and its heroine\u2019s independence. These plot elements would have been impossible to film a year later, after the Code had been reconstituted. Indeed, the film\u2019s reissue was repeatedly rejected by the Production Code Administration in the mid- to late \u201930s.\n35mm, b/w, 103 min.\nDirector: John Stahl\n",
