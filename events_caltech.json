        "description": "Rapid changes in membrane potential facilitate the unique physiology of electrically-excitable cells like neurons and cardiomyocytes. Even in non-electrically excitable cells, where membrane potential changes can be much slower, voltage is linked to a variety of cell outcomes including differentiation, cell cycle, and cancer aggressiveness. Despite the central importance of membrane potential dynamics, methods to accurately monitor voltage rely on highly invasive electrodes or indirect optical measurements, such as calcium imaging with fluorescent sensors. Direct visualization of voltage changes has the potential to couple the speed and sensitivity of electrode-based methods with the spatial resolution of imaging approaches. However, the development of fast, sensitive, and bright voltage-sensitive fluorescent indicators remains an outstanding challenge. Here, I present our efforts to design, synthesize, and apply fluorescent indicators that use photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) as a voltage-sensing trigger to achieve fast and sensitive voltage imaging in a variety of biological contexts.",

        "link": "https://www.caltech.edu/campus-life-events/master-calendar/ee-systems-seminar-60",
        "description": "ABSTRACT Modern machine learning algorithms are often trained in the overparameterized regime where the number of parameters in the model exceeds the size of the training dataset. Despite overparameterization, these algorithms surprisingly avoid overfitting to the training data. In this talk I will present theoretical results demystifying this success by focusing on two class of problems. In the first class of problems we avoid overfitting by using a model prior, such as sparsity, to narrow down the search space of the algorithm by using a proper regularization. For these problems, we introduce a general framework to quantify the benefit of prior knowledge in terms of problem geometry. This leads to a remarkably accurate characterization of the algorithmic behavior including estimation error, rate of convergence, and sample complexity. The second class of problems typically arise in deep learning and require no explicit regularization during training. While neural networks have the capacity to overfit any dataset including noise, somewhat paradoxically, they continue to predict well on unseen test data. Towards explaining this phenomena, we show that, neural networks trained by the gradient descent algorithm (1) are provably robust to noise/corruption on a constant fraction of the labels and (2) provably generalize to test data despite overparametrization.

        "description": "Abstract: Semidefinite programming is a powerful tool in the design and analysis of approximation algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems. In particular, the random hyperplane rounding method of Goemans and Williamson has been extensively studied for more than two decades, resulting in various extensions to the original technique and beautiful algorithms for a wide range of applications. Despite the fact that this approach yields tight approximation guarantees for some problems, like Max Cut, for many others, like Max Sat, Max DiCut, and constraint satisfaction problems with global constraints, the tight approximation ratio is still unknown. One of the main reasons for this is the fact that very few techniques for rounding semi-definite relaxations are known. In this work, we present a new general and simple method for rounding semi-definite programs, based on Brownian motion. Our approach is inspired by recent results in algorithmic discrepancy theory. We develop and present tools for analyzing our new rounding algorithms, utilizing mathematical machinery from the theory of Brownian motion, complex analysis, and partial differential equations. Focusing on constraint satisfaction problems, we apply our method to several classical problems, including Max Cut, Max 2-Sat, and Max DiCut, and derive new algorithms that are competitive with the best known results. We further show that our algorithms can be used, together with the Sum of Squares hierarchy, to approximate constraint satisfaction problems subject to multiple global cardinality constraints.

        "link": "https://www.caltech.edu/campus-life-events/master-calendar/geology-club-seminar-299",
        "description": "Understanding the interactions between microorganisms and their substrates requires knowledge of the community structure and assessment of the spatial distribution of metabolic activity. The challenges associated with identifying cells in the subsurface has parallels to those faced by life detection missions on other planetary bodies. Here we demonstrate a novel technique combining stable isotope probing (SIP) and Deep UV (DUV) Raman spectroscopy as a means to trace microbial metabolic activity on complex environmental substrates. First, we show that DUV Raman spectroscopy can differentiate an organic signal from a definitively biological one as a result of the unique molecular complexity inherent to living organisms. Second, using SIP we show that DUV Raman spectroscopy can differentiate bacterial cells grown in isotopically labeled media on environmental substrates based on downshifting of characteristic Raman peaks. Finally, a combined DUV Raman-SIP approach has the potential to identify microbial activity while obtaining the spatial community structure relative to the environmental substrate through correlated DUV fluorescence spectroscopy mapping. In situ field incubations of mineral substrates in a deep continental setting illustrate the ability of scanning DUV fluorescence to localize and visualize biomass on environmental substrates. The ability of DUV Raman to effectively identify regions containing cells that have incorporated isotopic labels combined with targeted fluorescence mapping will facilitate in situ detection of active community members on natural mineral substrates, providing a crucial link between microbial activity and environmental context. The ability to differentiate organic matter from cellular material is a critical step for life detection and fundamental to biosignature detection for both assessing microbial colonization in the deep subsurface and the search for life on other potentially habitable worlds such as Mars.",

In 2009, Swingle argued that MERA is a lattice realization of the AdS/CFT correspondence, with the tensor network representing a time slice of AdS, namely hyperbolic space H2. Other authors have since then argued that, instead, MERA represents de Sitter spacetime dS2. I will introduce a criterion, based on CFT path integrals, to unambiguously assign a geometry to a tensor network and then conclude that MERA is neither H2 nor dS2, but actually a light cone L2. Finally, I will introduce two new tensor networks, euclidean MERA and lorentzian MERA, corresponding to H2 and dS2 and discuss the implications of these results for holography and the study of quantum field theory in curved spacetime.",

In a collaboration with Dinakar Ramakrishnan we provide first evidence in higher dimension, in the case of abelian families parametrized by Picard modular surfaces over an imaginary quadratic field M. Namely, we establish a uniform irreducibility of Galois acting on the l-primary part of principally polarized Abelian 3-folds with multiplication by M, but without CM factors.",

Also, what had been initially set up to aid in the reconstruction of European societies came to be widely understood as \u201c Hitler\u2019s Secret Archive .\u201d Germany and the Red Cross consistently exploited the humanitarian service of tracing missing victims of Nazi tyranny to promote and legitimize their postwar agendas.

        "description": "Location: Donald Wright Auditorium, Pasadena Public Library, 285 E. Walnut St. in Pasadena The Pasadena Folk Music Society, in partnership with the Pasadena Public Library , presents a free concert for the entire family! Cambalache plays Son Jarocho music of Vera Cruz, Mexico, birthplace of founding member, Cesar Castro. This music is popular on Mexico's Gulf Coast, a cultural region shaped by indigenous and African culture, as well as Spanish. Cambalache's name comes from the Spanish word for \"exchange\" which acknowledges the group's emphasis on audience participation. Cambalache features an aranja or two, a requinto (the \"little guitars\"), Chuy Sandoval's occasional electric guitar, and Juan Perez's electric upright bass, the East L.A. influence of the band. And then there is lots of great singing, all proving that this joyous music is for all ages. Whether you are a longtime fan of Son Jarocho music or a newcomer, you will be delighted by this performance. We will also be treated to the dancing of Xochi Flores. Most of their songs are traditional, though they also compose originals. Children (and accompanying adults!) will be encouraged to do a bit of dancing, and everybody gets to sing. Cesar, Xochi, and Chuy sing in Spanish, but they describe the music in English, and nobody is left out. This show is funded by a generous cash award to the Pasadena Folk Music Society from the Topanga Banjo\u2022Fiddle Contest , which has enabled the Folk Music Society, with the help of the Pasadena Public Library, to make this a free performance, with no tickets or reservations required .

        "description": "Abstract: The first part of the presentation will introduce our methodology towards improving molecular catalysts for energy relevant conversions. We strategically introduce redox-active and slightly acidic imidazolium moieties into the secondary coordination sphere of molecular CO2 reduction electrocatalysts. Results from systematic comparative studies will be presented that strongly suggest that mechanistic details of catalysis are altered for the new functionalized catalyst systems, resulting in improved catalytic metrics. The second part of the seminar will discuss our strategies to study intramolecular interactions between transition metal (TM) and lanthanide (Ln) ions to generate novel spin systems that can display single-molecule magnet (SMM) properties. SMMs are very attractive candidates for the miniaturization of tunable information storage materials and quantum computing devices. Our work aims to generate heterometallic SMMs that feature either TM\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Ln interactions or TM\u2011Ln bonding. I will present key results of our comprehensive structural and spectroscopic studies which have already led to the development of redox-switchable SMMs, new molecular platforms to facilitate strong magnetic coupling between Ln3+ ions, and hard SMM behavior. The \"2\" in CO2 is subscripted. \u00a0The \"3+\" in Ln3+ is superscripted.",

        "description": "Our sense of smell plays a central role in our interaction with the world around us. We can detect a vast number of individual and mixed odorants of diverse structure, informing our selection and enjoyment of food, alerting us to hazards, and even guiding our choice of a mate. In exploring the molecular basis of mammalian olfaction I select from both the worst- and best-smelling odorants: thiols and musks. While the vibration theory of olfaction (VTO) proposes that the unique thiol IR absorption at 2500 cm-1 is responsible for their characteristic odor, our work establishes that ionic copper plays a key role in the binding of sulfur compounds to mammalian olfactory receptors (ORs). While the VTO argues that deuterated compounds have different odors than their non-deuterated counterparts, our work using deuterated musks establishes that there is no difference in the binding of deuterated and non-deuterated odorants to ORs. We propose that the molecular basis of olfaction can best be explained by the docking theory of olfaction, involving weak noncovalent electrostatic, van der Waals, H-bonding, dipole\u2212dipole, pi\u2013pi, metal ion, pi-cation, and hydrophobic odorant-receptor interactions.",

We will examine two well-known decision problems (path planning and online learning), and in both cases establish sharp, information-theoretic complexity vs. privacy tradeoff. As a by-product, our analysis also leads to simple yet provably efficient algorithms for both the decision maker and eavesdropping adversary. Based in part on joint work with Mine Su Erturk (Stanford GSB), John N. Tsitsiklis (MIT LIDS) and Zhi Xu (MIT LIDS).",

        "description": "Mechanics of fracture and failure of solids continues to elicit challenges in terms of modeling and simulation, and investigation of the physical mechanisms in a range of engineering, biological and geological materials like metals, polymers, and rocks. Here, I will give an overview of two major efforts in my group focusing on addressing the multiscale nature of fracture in two seemingly different but societally relevant applications: (1)Physics-based modeling of earthquake propagation on frictional interfaces , and (2) modeling of fracture in soft materials. In the first half of my talk, I will focus on a new computational algorithm for modeling earthquake ruptures with high resolution fault zone physics. I will present a hybrid method that combines Finite element method (FEM) and Spectral boundary integral (SBI) equation through the consistent exchange of displacement and traction boundary conditions, thereby benefiting from the flexibility of FEM in handling problems with nonlinearities or small-scale heterogeneities and from the superior performance and accuracy of SBI. I will present a verification of the hybrid method using a benchmark problem from the Southern California Earthquake Center\u2019s dynamic rupture simulation validation exercises and show that the method enables exact near field truncation of the elastodynamic solution. I will further demonstrate the capability and computational efficiency of the hybrid scheme for resolving off-fault complexities using a unique model of a fault zone with explicit representation of small scale secondary faults and branches enabling new insights into earthquake rupture dynamics that may not be realizable in homogenized isotropic plasticity or damage models. Next, I will briefly discuss our recent efforts in extending this method to consistently simulate sequences of seismic and aseismic slip in a fault zone by combining adaptive explicit and implicit integration schemes enabling us to vary the time step over more than seven orders of magnitude and to potentially explore the interplay between geometric, rheological, and frictional complexities over short and long time scales.",

The goal of the presentation is to describe the most common of these failure types and to provide, through historical example, insight enabling recognition and avoidance of the most common traps early in the design process.

        "description": "Abstract: Empirical applications of dynamic discrete choice models usually either take the discount factor to be known or rely on ad hoc functional form assumptions to identify and estimate it. We give identification results under economically motivated exclusion restrictions on primitive utilities. We show that each such exclusion restriction leads to an easily interpretable moment condition with the discount factor as the only unknown parameter. The identified set of discount factors that solves this condition is finite, but not necessarily a singleton. Consequently, in contrast to common intuition, an exclusion restriction does not provide point identification. In applications, multiple exclusion restrictions are often available. The discount factor can be set estimated from the corresponding moment conditions using existing methods without solving the choice model. Finally, we show that exclusion restrictions have nontrivial empirical content: The implied moment conditions impose restrictions on choices that are absent from the unconstrained model.

        "description": "Abstract : In the past decade, breath has become an increasingly explored bioanalyte for clinical biomarker discovery. Breath contains hundreds of volatile metabolic products from the body and can be sampled non-invasively for analysis at the point of care. However, since the first report of quantitative breath analysis by Linus Pauling in 1971, few robust breath biomarkers have been discovered and used in the clinic. In this talk, I will discuss an alternative approach to breath-based diagnostics using inhalable nanoparticles that we have engineered to release synthetic volatiles in response to aberrant protease activity in the lungs. The advantages of this approach are four-fold: (1) high sensitivity due to protease-driven readouts (2) high specificity through multiplexing (3) minimal background through use of biorthogonal volatile reporters and (4) a priori knowledge of the biological pathways driving breath signal. My interests lie in respiratory infections in which we can leverage both host and bacterial proteases. I will discuss my progress on this front and how this platform can be paired with machine learning to address clinical needs such as rapid pathogen identification.

        "description": "The Pasadena Folk Music Society is proud to present Jayme Stone and Folklife, a fine group of musicians who explore the deep roots music of North America and beyond. This is a completely new show, a follow-up to an earlier tour and album called the Lomax Project, which was performed here at Caltech with a slightly different line-up three years ago. They are touring the country, winding up in New York's Carnegie Hall in June. Jayme Stone is a Canadian banjo innovator, known for his bringing together diverse music, be it Bach or from Africa. His range is tremendous and his knowledge of the music insures that it will be an authentic rendering. The program treats old field recordings not as time capsules, but as heirloom seeds passed down from a bygone generation. Planting these sturdy seeds in modern soil, this versatile gathering of musicians\u2014 Moira Smiley , Sumaia Jackson and Joe Phillips \u2014has cultivated vibrant Sea Island spirituals, Creole calypsos, and stomp-down Appalachian dance tunes for contemporary listeners. Focusing on songs collected from field recordings at the Library of Congress, this ensemble preserves the essence of these fine recordings, while polishing them just a bit with contemporary nuances. Their recording based on this project, Jayme Stone's Folklife , was nominated for a Juno Award (Canada's Grammy equivalent) in the Traditional Roots Album of the Year category in 2018.

        "description": "Abstract : In this talk, I present my work on matching and pricing for ridesharing platforms, where drivers' strategic behavior (e.g. cherry-picking trips, and declining trips to chase surge prices) undercut their stated mission of providing transportation as reliable as running water.\" I introduce the Spatio-Temporal Pricing mechanism, which uses information about supply and demand over a planning horizon, solves for the welfare-optimal matching, and sets prices that are smooth\" in both space and time. In this way, the mechanism aligns incentives for drivers and promotes reliability without using penalties or time-extended contracts always accepting all trip dispatches forms a subgame-perfect equilibrium among the drivers. The mechanism also satisfies fairness properties, including that drivers at the same location and time do not envy each other's continuation payoffs. The mechanism is also robust, in that it achieves optimality along with other axiomatic properties from any history onward, including after a deviation. Simulation analysis suggests that the STP mechanism can achieve significantly higher social welfare than a myopic pricing mechanism. Bio : Hongyao Ma is a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science in the Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard, advised by Prof. David C. Parkes. Her research is broadly situated at the intersection of economics and computer science, and draws on concepts from multi-agent systems and game theory. She is particularly interested in designing market-based systems to bring people together in useful ways, in the presence of uncertainty, self-interest, and autonomy. Ma is a recipient of the Siebel Scholarship, Harvard SEAS fellowship, the UCLA-CSST scholarship, and the Derek Bok Center Certificate of Distinction in Teaching at Harvard. Ma received her M.S. in 2014 at Harvard, and B.E. in 2012 at Xi'an Jiaotong University, both in Electrical Engineering. She interned at Uber in the summer of 2017, visited Technion in the summer of 2016, worked as a research intern at AT&T Labs Research in the summer of 2013, and visited UCLA as a part of the CSST Program in 2011.

Dr. Simon's lab explores the interface of condensed matter physics and quantum optics, employing tools from atomic physics, control theory, and state-of-the-art technology developed in-house. The group builds materials from light, investigates the role of topology in determining material properties, and tackles challenges at the crossroads between strong correlations and quantum coherence. Their research interests include: atomic physics, quantum optics, and feedback control, with a particular emphasis on the interface with quantum many-body physics. The group is presently exploring photonic quantum materials, photonic topological meta-materials, and hybridizing the two. Collaborative efforts include studies of circuit-QED-based quantum materials, as well as interfacing mm-wave and optical photons through Rydberg atoms. More information willl be available in the coming weeks. The KNI Distinguished Seminar Series is a new monthly series hosted by The Kavli Nanoscience Institute where eminent scientists and thinkers with strong yet varied backgrounds in nanoscience and nanotechnology share their expertise with the Caltech community. Seminars consist of a one-hour presentation, followed by a Q&A and light reception. The scopes of presentations may range from: recent outstanding scientific highlights/technological advancements, to innovative early-stage research developments, to broader cross-disciplinary topics that are relevant to nanoscience. Each seminar will be recorded and made available to the public via the KNI's YouTube page .",

While Feddersen and Pesendorfer find that less informed, indifferent voters strictly prefer abstention, which they refer to as the swing voter's curse, I show that there exists an equilibrium in which everyone truthfully reveals his/her preference in the poll and participates in voting. Moreover, I find that even in the truth-telling equilibrium, the candidate who wins the poll may be defeated in the election. In a large election, however, polls can still help information aggregation.",

Roughly speaking, these principles assert that your current opinions should cohere with your anticipated future opinions. I will show that both principles can be justified by three types of arguments, which are based on expected accuracy, diachronic coherence, and the value of information. Together these arguments establish reflection and martingale principles as important guides to rational learning.",

Biologics are addressing previous unmet medical needs, but are challenging to manufacture and therefore high in cost. In this talk, I will describe our efforts to develop synthetic alternatives to biologics used in medicine. In the first example, a multivalent polymer displaying a fibrin-binding peptide was developed as a synthetic alternative to recombinant proteins used in trauma medicine. The second example, a polymer that facilitates intracellular delivery of nucleic acids and peptides was synthesized based on design principles learned from adenoviral vectors. In a final example, a unique aptamer with high affinity for T cell marker CD8 was discovered and applied as an alternative to antibodies for T cell isolation in the manufacturing process for CAR T cells.",

        "description": "Neuronal circuit architecture and directional connectivity determine functionality, communication, and computation in the brain. The development of microfluidics and microfabrication technologies made it possible to develop compartmentalized lab-on-chip platforms to grow and manipulate neuronal networks, to address specific questions extending from axonal guidance, synapse formation, or axonal transport, to the development of 2D/3D models for deciphering pathophysiological pathways, or for pharmacological testing and drug screening. This novel approach can be used for almost any type of neuronal circuits or brain disorders and is enabling new insights into neurobiological events previously unachievable through traditional cell biology techniques. Our team provided the first proof of concept that neuronal populations could be connected in a directional manner by controlling axonal outgrowth through physical constraints using asymmetrical microchannels to guide axons. These \"neuronal diodes\", can be established with primary neurons from different regions of the brain (e.g. cortex, striatum, hippocampus) and with human neurons obtained by cell-reprogramming (hiPSCs). The technology is adaptable to many experimental settings and readouts, and to parallelization for high-content screening. It has also many applications including the potential to accurately model acute and chronic neurodegeneration. I will present applications of the neuronal diodes to model Alzheimer\u2019s Disease on chip, as part of a drug discovery strategy that led us to found a critical role of the cysteine protease Caspase-2 and to validate on-chip a newly designed selective Caspase-2 inhibitor. Biography: Etienne Jacotot is Research Director at Inserm (Paris, France). He received a B.Sc. in molecular biology and genetics from University Paris 11 Orsay in 1993 and M.Sc. and PhD in immunology from Institut Pasteur and University Paris 11 in 1994 and 1997. He did a post-doctoral training in the Guido Kroemer's lab, where he discovered a mitochondrial target for the HIV-1 Viral protein R, described the role of mitochondria and caspases in HIV Env-mediated syncytial apoptosis, and contributed to the characterization of mitochondrial Apoptosis-Inducing Factor. In 2001, he cofounded and directed for 8 years a VC-funded biotech company where he settled mitochondria-based phenotypic screening platforms, identified Caspase-2 as a target in neonatal brain damage, and managed the preclinical development of a neuroprotective drug candidate. After a Visiting Professor position at Imperial College London (UK) from 2009 to 2014, he joined IBPS - Sorbonne University. His research group develop translational approaches to target Caspase-2 and develops neurofluidic microsystems to control the architecture of neuronal circuits in vitro, in a translational perspective. He contributed to 78 research publications (Hindex = 36; citations: > 10 150) and he is named inventor of 28 patent applications.

        "description": "NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, one of the four great NASA Observatories, observes the universe in the infrared. It essentially operates as an enormous pair of night-vision goggles, allowing it to perceive invisible \"heat\" radiation and pierce through dust clouds, something impossible for visible light. Because of its unique view of the sky, Spitzer has achieved major discoveries in almost every area of astrophysics. It has detected some of the oldest galaxies in our universe, discovered a new ring around Saturn, and observed the seven Earth-sized planets in the TRAPPIST-1 exoplanetary system. Now, after 16 years of continuous operation, well exceeding its planned 2.5-year primary mission duration, Spitzer is set to retire in the next year. Come discover the universe in the infrared and the remarkable legacy the NASA Spitzer Space Telescope has provided. About the Series Stargazing Lectures are free lectures at a public level followed by guided stargazing with telescopes (weather permitting). All events are held at the Cahill Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics at Caltech. No reservations are needed. Lectures are 30 minutes; stargazing lasts 90 minutes. Stay only as long as you want. Stargazing is only possible with clear skies, but the lecture, slideshow, and Q&A takes place regardless of weather.

        "description": "Award-winning author Jessica Shattuck will discuss her New York Times bestselling novel, The Women in the Castle . The book tells the story of three German widows living together in a crumbling castle in Bavaria in the immediate aftermath of World War II. While their husbands were executed for their participation in the July 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler, the women\u2019s own beliefs and experiences span the gamut of the German political spectrum. It is as much about complicity as it is about resistance and offers a new and different look at WWII from the German point of view. Shattuck, who is herself of German descent, will share how she came to write the book and what she learned in her research about this time in history. Shattuck\u2019s other novels include Perfect Life and The Hazards of Good Breeding , which was a New York Times Notable Book, a Boston Globe Book of the Year, and a finalist for the 2003 PEN/Winship Award. Her fiction has appeared in The New Yorker , Glamour , Open City , and The Tampa Review among other publications.

        "description": "Abstract : Superconducting circuits have emerged as one of the leading platforms for realizing a universal quantum computer. They are relatively easy to design, simulate, and fabricate, and their coherence times have improved enormously over the past decade. However, to date there still does not exist a clear technology roadmap for building a fault-tolerant computer due to several challenges. An error-corrected processor with even a relatively small number of logical qubits (~100) will require orders of magnitude many more physical qubits than anything demonstrated to date. So a first challenge is that, because resonant electromagnetic circuits operating at microwave frequencies have large footprints, the space available to fabricate them on a chip is severely limited. In addition each qubit generally requires several lines for readout and control, so wiring a chip at the bottom of a dilution refrigerator quickly becomes intractable. Here I propose to alleviate these challenges by integrating superconducting qubits with nanomechanical resonators, using the latter as ultracompact quantum memories. I will first present an architecture in which a single superconducting qubit coupled to several resonators can be used to sequentially perform one and two qubit gates between any pair of them, turning the original qubit into a \u2018module\u2019 with a much larger Hilbert space. I will then present the first experimental demonstration of direct, resonant coupling between a superconducting circuit and a phononic crystal defect cavity (PCDC), a nanostructure which localizes sound waves at a single defect site in an artificial lattice. I will also show new results demonstrating strong coupling of a transmon qubit to an array of PCDCs with localized resonances in the gigahertz range. I will conclude with a discussion on how this platform additionally enables new demonstrations in quantum acoustics such as non-demolition detection of single phonons and generation of Schr\u00f6dinger cat states. Bio : Patricio ArrangoizArriola is a PhD candidate in Applied Physics at Stanford University, working in the group of Amir SafaviNaeini. He received a Bachelor\u2019s in Physics from Caltech in 2014, where he worked under the supervision of Paul Bellan and Axel Scherer. His doctoral research is on developing hybrid approaches to scaling up superconducting quantum computing technologies. As part of these efforts he worked on techniques to model and simulate the interaction of superconducting qubits and piezoelectric nanostructures and developed a set of fabrication processes to integrate these two technologies on a single chip. His work with lithium niobate has enabled the creation of new nanoscale devices that were previously inaccessible with this material, including phononic and optomechanical crystals directly wired to superconducting circuits. He also contributes to a number of other efforts in the group, including microwave-to-optical conversion of single photons with lithium niobate modulators and various experiments in circuit quantum electrodynamics.

        "description": "While small molecules offer a unique opportunity to target structural and regulatory elements in therapeutically relevant RNAs, selectivity has been a recurrent challenge in small molecule:RNA recognition.\u00a0 In particular, RNAs tend to be more dynamic and offer less chemical functionality than proteins, and biologically active ligands must compete with the highly abundant and highly structured RNA of the ribosome. Indeed, no small molecule drugs targeting RNAs other than the ribosome are currently available, and our recent survey of the literature revealed little more than one hundred reported chemical probes that target non-ribosomal RNA in biological systems. As part of our efforts to improve small molecule targeting strategies and gain fundamental insights into small molecule:RNA recognition, we are analyzing patterns in both RNA-biased small molecule chemical space and RNA topological space privileged for differentiation. To begin, we identified physicochemical, structural, and spatial properties of biologically active RNA ligands that are distinct from those of protein-targeted ligands. Elaboration of four RNA binding scaffolds into a library enriched with these properties has led to improved recognition of medicinally relevant RNA targets, including viral and long noncoding RNA structures. At the same time, we used pattern recognition protocols to identify RNA topologies that can be differentially recognized by small molecules and have elaborated this technique to visualize conformational changes in RNA secondary structure. We are currently expanding these studies with the ultimate goal of applying these insights to the rapid development of ligands with high affinity and specificity for a wide range of RNA targets, particularly those critical to cancer progression.",

This conformable, stretchable, self-healable and biodegradable material simultaneously collects signals from external stimuli that translate into information such as pressure, pain, and temperature. The development of electronic materials, inspired by the complexity of this organ is a tremendous, unrealized materials challenge. However, the advent of organic-based electronic materials may offer a potential solution to this longstanding problem. In this talk, I will describe the design of organic electronic materials to mimic skin functions. These new materials enabled new functions in medical devices, robotics and new manufacturing methods through the use of self-healing materials.",

        "description": "We pursue in a multi-dimensional approach the quantification of weak intermolecular interactions in chemical and biological systems. Examples discussed in the lecture are orthogonal dipolar interactions, organofluorine interactions, substituent effects on \u03c0-\u03c0-stacking interactions, halogen bonding, and chalcogen bonding. Enantioselective complexation based solely on dispersion interactions and perfect shape complementarity is achieved with new chiral alleno-acetylenic cage compounds. We also explore the energetics of the replacement of conserved water molecules in protein co-crystal structures by ligand parts, with a particular interest in cyclic water clusters. Lessons learned are directly applicable to ligand design and optimization in drug discovery and crop protection research, but equally to the assembly of synthetic supramolecular systems. The approach is illustrated in examples taken from our structure-based drug design projects. Specific examples for investigations of protein-ligand interactions include (i) addressing the Gly-rich ATP-triphosphate-binding loop of protein kinase A (PKA), (ii) complexation at the allosteric site of IspD, an enzyme from the non-mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis and deciphering of the allosteric mechanism, (iii) halogen-bonding at the active site of the cysteine protease hCatL, and (iv) ligand development against a novel target for antimalarials, serine hydroxymethyl transferase (SHMT), a key enzyme from the folate biosynthesis cycle.",

        "description": "Chen-Huang Sustainability Series Lecture: The California Experience Goes Global with Terry Tamminen, CEO of the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation Monday, April 22, 2019 | Ramo Auditorium 5:00 to 6:00 pm | Refreshments before starting at 4:30 pm About the Lecture In this presentation, former CalEPA Secretary Terry Tamminen examines California sustainability policies that succeeded in the state (including \"lessons learned\" and setbacks), but which also became models around the globe for advancing environmental protection and \"green\" economic development. He will also present a roadmap for policies and projects that could simultaneously save endangered species (and their habitats), address climate change, and create the biggest wealth-generating opportunity of the 21st Century. About the Speaker Terry has deep international expertise in business, agriculture, education, public policy and the environment. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger appointed him Secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency and later Cabinet Secretary, the Chief Policy Advisor to the Governor, where Terry was the architect of many groundbreaking sustainability policies, including California's landmark Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, the Hydrogen Highway Network, and the Million Solar Roofs initiative. In 2010 Terry co-founded the R20 Regions of Climate Action, a public-private partnership bringing together subnational governments, businesses, financial markets, NGOs, and academia to implement measurable, large-scale, low-carbon and climate resilient economic development projects that can simultaneously solve the climate crisis and build a sustainable global economy. Since 2007 he has provided advice to Pegasus Capital Advisors and numerous global businesses on sustainability and \"green\" investing. In 2016, Terry joined the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation as CEO. An accomplished author, Terry's books include \"Cracking the Carbon Code: The Keys to Sustainable Profits in the New Economy\" (Palgrave Macmillan). In 2011, Terry was one of six finalists for the Zayed Future Energy Prize and The Guardian ranked Terry No. 1 in its \"Top 50 People Who Can Save the Planet.\" This event is free and open to the public. No RSVP required. Seating is on a first-come, first-seated basis. The Chen-Huang Sustainability Series is made possible by the generous support of Dr. Marina Chen (MS '80 CS; PhD '83 CS) and Chi-Fu Huang.",

        "description": "Low clouds over subtropical oceans cool Earth's climate because they reflect most of the sunlight shining on them back to space. It is unclear, however, how the clouds themselves change with climate; this gives rise to large uncertainties in climate change projections. Tapio Schneider's lecture will show how advances in computing and satellite observations are enabling breakthroughs in the accuracy of climate projections. Such advances have already revealed a tipping point of the climate system: if greenhouse gas concentrations rise high enough, subtropical low clouds may melt away, triggering dramatic global warming. This event is free; no tickets or reservations are required. A minimum of 700 seats will be available on a first-come, first-served basis, beginning at 7:30 p.m. Reserved section tickets are available to members of The Friends of Beckman Auditorium and the Caltech Associates , and to Caltech alumni . About the Speaker Tapio Schneider is the Theodore Y. Wu Professor of Environmental Science and Engineering at Caltech in the Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences ; and Jet Propulsion Laboratory Senior Research Scientist. About the Series Since 1922, The Earnest C. Watson Lecture Series has has brought Caltech's most innovative scientific research to the public. The series is named for Earnest C. Watson, a professor of physics at Caltech from 1919 until 1959. Spotlighting a small selection of the pioneering research Caltech's faculty is currently conducting, the Watson Lectures are geared toward a general audience, as part of the Institute's ongoing commitment to benefiting the local community through education and outreach. Through a gift from the estate of Richard C. Biedebach, the lecture series is able to highlight an assistant professor's research each season. DOWNLOAD THE SERIES BROCHURE Find Us On Facebook",

He has been the principal investigator on an NIH-sponsored project to develop remote-controlled endovascular catheters for use in interventional MRI. This could revolutionize stroke treatment, allowing doctors to visualize living versus dead brain tissue in real-time during their surgeries. He is also the principal investigator on an NIH-sponsored project to develop an endovascular filtration device to reduce systemic toxicity during intraarterial chemotherapy for a variety of tumors. Such a device could not only reduce the side-effects of chemotherapy, but also enable better tumor control and, in some cases, cure. \r\nSteven Hetts is Chief of Interventional Neuroradiology at the UCSF Mission Bay Hospitals, where he provides cutting-edge, minimally invasive endovascular therapy for children and adults with stroke, cerebrovascular disease and tumors, including retinoblastoma. He founded the Interventional Neuroradiology services at San Francisco General Hospital and the San Francisco Veteran's Administration Hospital, where he served as Chief until 2015.  https://profiles.ucsf.edu/steven.hetts#narrative\r\n\r\nAnand S.

        "link": "https://www.caltech.edu/campus-life-events/master-calendar/caltech-young-investigators-lecture-24",
        "description": "Abstract : The study of vehicles traveling at hypersonic speeds is extremely complex and involves many physical processes occurring over a broad range of time-scales. Advances in both computational chemistry and computational power have enabled the construction of extremely detailed models for chemical non-equilibrium effects based on ab initio quantum chemistry data, referred to as the State-to-State (StS) model. Unfortunately, due to the enormous cost of both computing data for and applying the StS model, it can only be applied to highly simplified test cases. This motivates the development of reduced order models for chemical non-equilibrium which can capture the same physics at a reduced computational cost. The model reduction framework presented, based on the maximum-entropy principle, provides a link between the ab initio quantum chemistry data and computational fluid dynamics. The objective of this work is twofold: first to present a model reduction framework for application to chemical non-equilibrium based on fundamental physics principles; and second, to use this framework to study thermochemical non-equilibrium in a variety of conditions for a gas composed of nitrogen molecules. Bio : Robyn Macdonald received her B.S. in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2013, and will receive her PhD from UIUC in May 2019 under the guidance of Prof. Marco Panesi.

        "description": "The US department of defense tracks approximately 26000 resident space objects ranging from the size of a softball to a school bus. From these, roughly 2000 are actively controlled and all else are effectively space garbage. As such, they do not transmit their identities making them more difficult to track. Tracking is understood as both detecting and object and positively identifying it. Most of these objects are measured as point detection (i.e. non-resolved). Astrodynamics is the science that studies motion of resident space objects. There are four field effects driving RSO motion: gravitational, radiative, particulates, and geomagnetic. Of these, only the gravitational field effects are independent of the RSO\u2019s physical characteristics. The question then is, how do we positively identify all of the RSOs in the population and thus improve our ability to predict their behavior to satisfy a growing need for space safety, security, and sustainability? How do we deal with uncertainty comprised of both randomness and ignorance? Dr. Jah will describe current state of practice, compare this to state of the art, and identify scientific and engineering gaps that are in need of being satisfied. He will also provide a summary of his research program at UT Austin and how this focus area fits into a larger vision of rigorous and comprehensive space situational awareness and space traffic management.",

The de Leon group is focused on building quantum hardware with color centers in wide bandgap materials, such as NV centers in diamond. These color centers act as artificial atoms in the solid state, and can have remarkable optical and spin properties. We aim to explore fundamental device physics, materials engineering, and nanophotonics to gain full control over color centers to build them into scalable quantum devices, with the large-scale technological goals of realizing quantum networks and nanoscale sensors. Complementarily, we will search for new color centers for applications in quantum information processing and quantum sensing. In the near term, this toolkit will enable the exploration of fundamental quantum optics, magnetic interactions, and many body physics. Our lab is highly interdisciplinary, spanning optics and photonics, surface science and materials engineering, atomic and molecular spectroscopy, nanofabrication, and cryogenics. More information willl be available in the coming weeks. The KNI Distinguished Seminar Series is a new monthly series hosted by The Kavli Nanoscience Institute where eminent scientists and thinkers with strong yet varied backgrounds in nanoscience and nanotechnology share their expertise with the Caltech community. Seminars consist of a one-hour presentation, followed by a Q&A and light reception. The scopes of presentations may range from: recent outstanding scientific highlights/technological advancements, to innovative early-stage research developments, to broader cross-disciplinary topics that are relevant to nanoscience. Each seminar will be recorded and made available to the public via the KNI's YouTube page .",

        "link": "https://www.caltech.edu/campus-life-events/master-calendar/caltech-young-investigators-lecture-25",
        "description": "Abstract : Fluid-driven crack propagation concerns several areas of engineering, including structural, geotechnical, and petroleum engineering. The development of simulation tools for pressurized cracks propagating in realistic scenarios needs to tackle the complexity arising from the non-linear hydro-mechanical coupling of the fluid and the cracked solid in a suitable framework for large-scale applications. In this lecture, I will introduce the governing equations of hydraulic fracture and discuss well-known propagation regimes where the problem can be treated analytically. I will then present a computational approach to model the hydro-mechanical coupling of the fracturing solid and the fluid flow inside the propagating cracks. Benchmarks in 2D and 3D demonstrate the capability of the computational framework to successfully deal with a priori unknown and arbitrarily intricate crack paths, and with the need for large-scale simulations. Time permitting, I will describe other recent eorts in developing advanced next-generation computational algorithms for large-scale simulation of complex material response, including mechanical instabilities and material failure. Bio : Bianca Giovanardi is a Postdoctoral Associate in Computational Solid Mechanics in the group of Prof. Raul Radovitzky at the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at MIT. Her current research interests encompass next-generation computational models for failure analysis of solids under extreme loading in a variety of fields, including geophysics, aerospace, and defense. She earned her PhD in Computational Mathematics in 2017 from the Politecnico di Milano with a thesis proposing a novel method to simulate crack propagation in brittle materials. During her PhD, she was awarded a Roberto Rocca Doctoral Fellowship, which allowed her to spend six months at MIT developing high performance simulation tools for fluid-driven fracture propagation. When not coding or debugging, Bianca enjoys going on hikes, sailing and practicing water polo. This lecture is part of the Young Investigators Lecture Series sponsored by the Caltech Division of Engineering & Applied Science.",

        "description": "Professor Chien's research on how blood flow regulates interaction between the blood stream, blood cells and artery walls also leads to new information relevant to other types of cells, e.g., stem cells and cancer cells. At the molecular level, he is discovering how mechanical forces signal gene expression to cause cell growth, migration and cell death. Chien takes a multidisciplinary, integrative approach that combines engineering and biomedical sciences. He employs an array of technologies including nanotechnology, DNA microarrary, bioinformatics, cell biophysics and biomechanics in his research on the cardiovascular system.. https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/faculty/faculty_bios/index.sfe?fmp_recid=11\r\n\r\nBiography: Shu Chien joined UCSD in 1988 and became the founding chair of the Department of Bioengineering in 1994. In 2008, Chien became the founding Director of UC San Diego's new Institute of Engineering in Medicine to foster collaborations among the faculty of UCSD and with research institutes and biomedical companies in San Diego. As principal investigator on the Whitaker Foundation Development Award (1993) and Leadership Award (1998), Chien played a major role in establishing UCSD' bioengineering program as one of the top programs in the country. As founding Director of the UC Systemwide Bioengineering Institute in California, he has contributed to collaborations in research and education among the ten UC campuses. In September 2006, Chien was named the inaugural holder of the Y.C. Fung Endowed Chair in Bioengineering at the Jacobs School. He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences, and American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Chien won the US National Medal of Science in 2011. He received his M.D. from the National Taiwan University and his Ph.D. in Physiology from Columbia University, where he was a professor from 1969 to 1988. http://iem.ucsd.edu/",

        "description": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex assembly of structural proteins that provides physical support and biochemical signaling to cells in tissues. Over the last two decades, studies have revealed the important role that ECM elasticity plays in regulating a variety of biological processes in cells, including stem cell differentiation and cancer progression. However, tissues and ECM are often viscoelastic, displaying stress relaxation over time in response to a deformation. My group has been focused on elucidating the impact of ECM viscoelasticity on cells. Our approach involves the use engineered biomaterials for 3D culture, in which the mechanical properties can be independently modulated. In this talk, I will discuss our recent findings on how chondrocytes and stem cells sense ECM viscoelasticity, how cancer cells generate force to divide in growing tumors, and on mechanical regulation of breast cancer invasion.",

        "description": "Stars are the building blocks of galaxies and home to the planets. We must understand how stars form to explain many other aspects of the Universe, yet many mysteries remain about this complex process. Starting from the Big Bang, I will walk us through the chain of events that we know had to happen to produce a star like our Sun in a galaxy like the Milky Way. Then, I will talk about the main things we don't know: why do the stars form in the quantity that they do? Why is the typical mass of a newborn star the same everywhere we have looked? And why is star formation so slow? I will show how observations and theory are working together to answer these fundamental questions about how a star is born. About the Series Stargazing Lectures are free lectures at a public level followed by guided stargazing with telescopes (weather permitting). All events are held at the Cahill Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics at Caltech. No reservations are needed. Lectures are 30 minutes; stargazing lasts 90 minutes. Stay only as long as you want. Stargazing is only possible with clear skies, but the lecture, slideshow, and Q&A takes place regardless of weather.

        "description": "X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES or NEXAFS) is a powerful technique for electronic structure determination.\u00a0 However, widespread use of XANES is limited by the need for synchrotron light sources with tunable x-ray energy. Recent developments in extreme ultraviolet (XUV) light sources using the laser-based technique of high-harmonic generation have enabled core-level spectroscopy to be performed on femtosecond to attosecond timescales.\u00a0 We have extended the scope of tabletop XUV spectroscopy and demonstrated that M2,3-edge XANES, corresponding to 3p\u21923d transitions, can reliably measure the electronic structure of first-row transition metal coordination complexes with femtosecond time resolution.\u00a0 We use this ability to track the excited-state relaxation pathways of photocatalysts and spin crossover complexes.\u00a0 In semiconductors such as CH3NH3PbI3, distinct signals are observed for photoinduced electrons and holes, allowing the dynamics of each carrier to be tracked independently.\u00a0 This work establishes extreme ultraviolet spectroscopy as a useful tool for mainstream research in inorganic, organometallic, and materials chemistry.

Within this regime we have exploited cooperative Lewis base/transition metal catalysis as an effective means to control and direct both reaction partners during\u00a0 bond construction. The versatility of this approach is such that each catalyst acts in an orthogonal manner, which permits the role and function of the metal center to be modified and tuned without compromising enantioselectivity. This seminar will describe our most recent efforts in asymmetric carbon\u2013carbon\u00a0 and carbon-nitrogen bond formation.",

Glycans assemble into complex structures on the surfaces of cells, forming a thick, fuzzy coating that surrounds cells and modulates the ability of cells to communicate (with other cells). In her lecture, Linda Hsieh- Wilson will describe the development of new tools to help researchers uncover the roles of glycans in the brain, including their participation in neurological and psychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer's and autism. This event is free; no tickets or reservations are required. A minimum of 700 seats will be available on a first-come, first-served basis, beginning at 7:30 p.m. Reserved section tickets are available to members of The Friends of Beckman Auditorium and the Caltech Associates , and to Caltech alumni . About the Speaker Linda C. Hsieh-Wilson is the Arthur and Marian Hanisch Memorial Professor of Chemistry at Caltech in the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering .

        "link": "https://www.caltech.edu/campus-life-events/master-calendar/caltech-young-investigators-lecture",
        "description": "Abstract : Monodisperse micro-particles are crucial in medical/pharmaceutical applications and environmental assessment. Yet, given different particle-size-distributions in the original suspension, variations in the system design are required in many of the existing separation techniques (e.g. membrane filtration, microfluidic devices). In this talk, I will introduce a clog-free and cost-effective method to separate different polydisperse suspensions without changing the system set-up, simply using the interface of a bubble confined in a millimeter scale capillary. The particle and interface interaction will be introduced, which serves as the prerequisite condition for particle separation, followed by the critical dimension and particle separation criteria. Finally, with the time-dependent features of a confined bubble, we will be able to tune the separation criteria in-situ, and obtain multiple particle distribution functions (PDFs) in one single separation process. Bio : Estella Yu is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Princeton University, advised by Prof. Howard A. Stone. She received her B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Boston University. Estella is working in the Complex Fluids Group, whose research is built around multiphase flows, colloid science, physical chemistry, biophysics, etc. Estella\u2019s work has focused on multiphase flows and thin films, where she aims to develop an efficient and cost-effective separation technique by combining the results from analysis, experiments and simulations. This lecture is part of the Young Investigators Lecture Series sponsored by the Caltech Division of Engineering & Applied Science.",

        "description": "Abstract : A paradox of modern biology is that while metabolism is known to influence epigenetic signals (including, but not limited to histone acetylation), the specific proteins that sense these metabolic cues remain uncharacterized. Here we describe the utility of chemical methods to discover novel epigenetic mechanisms and characterize their metabolic regulation. Our initial studies have led to the identification of novel metabolic inhibitors of histone acetyltransferases, an expanded landscape of regulatory acetylation in gene expression control, and new signaling functions of the covalent oncometabolite fumarate. Through our efforts, we aim to define novel biological pathways which influence the development, progression, and treatment of cancer. Bio : Dr. Meier received his undergraduate degree in chemistry from Creighton University in 2004, getting introduced to research as an National Science Foundation REU student. Following graduation he moved to the University of California-San Diego, performing graduate research in natural products biochemistry and proteomics under the mentorship of Professor Michael D. Burkart. After receiving his Ph.D. in chemistry in 2009, he moved to the California Institute of Technology. His research as an American Cancer Society postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Professor Peter B. Dervan focused on the development of high-throughput sequencing methods to analyze small molecule-DNA interactions. In 2013, Dr. Meier joined the NCI, where his research focuses on the development of synthetic probes to investigate metabolic and epigenetic signaling pathways in cancer.",

        "description": "A scarce two decades ago, the idea of other worlds around other stars, inhabited by other beings, lived in the realms of philosophy and science fiction. And yet here we stand today, counting these distant planets in the thousands, and slowly peering down through their atmospheres to answer questions about their habitability. It is staggering to think that this exoplanet revolution is happening in our lifetimes \u2014 that we will be remembered as the generation that discovered other worlds. The question now becomes, will we also be the first ones to find life in the Universe beyond Earth? About the Series Stargazing Lectures are free lectures at a public level followed by guided stargazing with telescopes (weather permitting). All events are held at the Cahill Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics at Caltech. No reservations are needed. Lectures are 30 minutes; stargazing lasts 90 minutes. Stay only as long as you want. Stargazing is only possible with clear skies, but the lecture, slideshow, and Q&A takes place regardless of weather.
