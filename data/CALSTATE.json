The conference provides training and professional development opportunities for students, practitioners and community members. Our third annual conference seeks to provide attendees with critical understandings and practical knowledge that can be used to enrich their scholarship, service provision, and relationships while also inspiring thoughtful and intentional community action. In this contemporary moment, we are especially concerned with how social and political climates directly affect our mental health and well-being.\u00a0From immigration law to climate change, the contentious social issues of our time have the greatest effect on the most vulnerable and marginalized populations in society. Our theme this year is a call to counselors, psychologists, educators, scholars and practitioners to explore connections between mental health and the socio-political environment. Register online for the conference. *Space is not guaranteed for registrations at the door on the day of the event. Last year's conference was at capacity. Conference scholarships are available to Cal State LA students online at 2019 Mental and Behavioral Health Conference Scholarship Application.
