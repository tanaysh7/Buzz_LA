   "description": "\"Connection of the Mind and Body: Impact of the Current Social and Political Climate,\" is the third annual Mental and Behavioral Health Conference. The conference provides training and professional development opportunities for students, practitioners and community members. Our third annual conference seeks to provide attendees with critical understandings and practical knowledge that can be used to enrich their scholarship, service provision, and relationships while also inspiring thoughtful and intentional community action. In this contemporary moment, we are especially concerned with how social and political climates directly affect our mental health and well-being.\u00a0From immigration law to climate change, the contentious social issues of our time have the greatest effect on the most vulnerable and marginalized populations in society. Our theme this year is a call to counselors, psychologists, educators, scholars and practitioners to explore connections between mental health and the socio-political environment. Register online for the conference. *Space is not guaranteed for registrations at the door on the day of the event. Last year's conference was at capacity. Conference scholarships are available to Cal State LA students online at 2019 Mental and Behavioral Health Conference Scholarship Application.

   "description": "Rapid changes in membrane potential facilitate the unique physiology of electrically-excitable cells like neurons and cardiomyocytes. Even in non-electrically excitable cells, where membrane potential changes can be much slower, voltage is linked to a variety of cell outcomes including differentiation, cell cycle, and cancer aggressiveness. Despite the central importance of membrane potential dynamics, methods to accurately monitor voltage rely on highly invasive electrodes or indirect optical measurements, such as calcium imaging with fluorescent sensors. Direct visualization of voltage changes has the potential to couple the speed and sensitivity of electrode-based methods with the spatial resolution of imaging approaches. However, the development of fast, sensitive, and bright voltage-sensitive fluorescent indicators remains an outstanding challenge. Here, I present our efforts to design, synthesize, and apply fluorescent indicators that use photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) as a voltage-sensing trigger to achieve fast and sensitive voltage imaging in a variety of biological contexts.",

   "description": "ABSTRACT Modern machine learning algorithms are often trained in the overparameterized regime where the number of parameters in the model exceeds the size of the training dataset. Despite overparameterization, these algorithms surprisingly avoid overfitting to the training data. In this talk I will present theoretical results demystifying this success by focusing on two class of problems. In the first class of problems we avoid overfitting by using a model prior, such as sparsity, to narrow down the search space of the algorithm by using a proper regularization. For these problems, we introduce a general framework to quantify the benefit of prior knowledge in terms of problem geometry. This leads to a remarkably accurate characterization of the algorithmic behavior including estimation error, rate of convergence, and sample complexity. The second class of problems typically arise in deep learning and require no explicit regularization during training. While neural networks have the capacity to overfit any dataset including noise, somewhat paradoxically, they continue to predict well on unseen test data. Towards explaining this phenomena, we show that, neural networks trained by the gradient descent algorithm (1) are provably robust to noise/corruption on a constant fraction of the labels and (2) provably generalize to test data despite overparametrization.

   "description": "Abstract: Semidefinite programming is a powerful tool in the design and analysis of approximation algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems. In particular, the random hyperplane rounding method of Goemans and Williamson has been extensively studied for more than two decades, resulting in various extensions to the original technique and beautiful algorithms for a wide range of applications. Despite the fact that this approach yields tight approximation guarantees for some problems, like Max Cut, for many others, like Max Sat, Max DiCut, and constraint satisfaction problems with global constraints, the tight approximation ratio is still unknown. One of the main reasons for this is the fact that very few techniques for rounding semi-definite relaxations are known. In this work, we present a new general and simple method for rounding semi-definite programs, based on Brownian motion. Our approach is inspired by recent results in algorithmic discrepancy theory. We develop and present tools for analyzing our new rounding algorithms, utilizing mathematical machinery from the theory of Brownian motion, complex analysis, and partial differential equations. Focusing on constraint satisfaction problems, we apply our method to several classical problems, including Max Cut, Max 2-Sat, and Max DiCut, and derive new algorithms that are competitive with the best known results. We further show that our algorithms can be used, together with the Sum of Squares hierarchy, to approximate constraint satisfaction problems subject to multiple global cardinality constraints.

   "description": "Understanding the interactions between microorganisms and their substrates requires knowledge of the community structure and assessment of the spatial distribution of metabolic activity. The challenges associated with identifying cells in the subsurface has parallels to those faced by life detection missions on other planetary bodies. Here we demonstrate a novel technique combining stable isotope probing (SIP) and Deep UV (DUV) Raman spectroscopy as a means to trace microbial metabolic activity on complex environmental substrates. First, we show that DUV Raman spectroscopy can differentiate an organic signal from a definitively biological one as a result of the unique molecular complexity inherent to living organisms. Second, using SIP we show that DUV Raman spectroscopy can differentiate bacterial cells grown in isotopically labeled media on environmental substrates based on downshifting of characteristic Raman peaks. Finally, a combined DUV Raman-SIP approach has the potential to identify microbial activity while obtaining the spatial community structure relative to the environmental substrate through correlated DUV fluorescence spectroscopy mapping. In situ field incubations of mineral substrates in a deep continental setting illustrate the ability of scanning DUV fluorescence to localize and visualize biomass on environmental substrates. The ability of DUV Raman to effectively identify regions containing cells that have incorporated isotopic labels combined with targeted fluorescence mapping will facilitate in situ detection of active community members on natural mineral substrates, providing a crucial link between microbial activity and environmental context. The ability to differentiate organic matter from cellular material is a critical step for life detection and fundamental to biosignature detection for both assessing microbial colonization in the deep subsurface and the search for life on other potentially habitable worlds such as Mars.",

   "description": "The multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) is a 2 dimensional tensor network that describes the ground state of a critical quantum spin chain (or vacuum of a 2d CFT on the lattice). In 2009, Swingle argued that MERA is a lattice realization of the AdS/CFT correspondence, with the tensor network representing a time slice of AdS, namely hyperbolic space H2. Other authors have since then argued that, instead, MERA represents de Sitter spacetime dS2. I will introduce a criterion, based on CFT path integrals, to unambiguously assign a geometry to a tensor network and then conclude that MERA is neither H2 nor dS2, but actually a light cone L2. Finally, I will introduce two new tensor networks, euclidean MERA and lorentzian MERA, corresponding to H2 and dS2 and discuss the implications of these results for holography and the study of quantum field theory in curved spacetime.",

   "description": "Location: Donald Wright Auditorium, Pasadena Public Library, 285 E. Walnut St. in Pasadena The Pasadena Folk Music Society, in partnership with the Pasadena Public Library , presents a free concert for the entire family! Cambalache plays Son Jarocho music of Vera Cruz, Mexico, birthplace of founding member, Cesar Castro. This music is popular on Mexico's Gulf Coast, a cultural region shaped by indigenous and African culture, as well as Spanish. Cambalache's name comes from the Spanish word for \"exchange\" which acknowledges the group's emphasis on audience participation. Cambalache features an aranja or two, a requinto (the \"little guitars\"), Chuy Sandoval's occasional electric guitar, and Juan Perez's electric upright bass, the East L.A. influence of the band. And then there is lots of great singing, all proving that this joyous music is for all ages. Whether you are a longtime fan of Son Jarocho music or a newcomer, you will be delighted by this performance. We will also be treated to the dancing of Xochi Flores. Most of their songs are traditional, though they also compose originals. Children (and accompanying adults!) will be encouraged to do a bit of dancing, and everybody gets to sing. Cesar, Xochi, and Chuy sing in Spanish, but they describe the music in English, and nobody is left out. This show is funded by a generous cash award to the Pasadena Folk Music Society from the Topanga Banjo\u2022Fiddle Contest , which has enabled the Folk Music Society, with the help of the Pasadena Public Library, to make this a free performance, with no tickets or reservations required .

   "description": "Abstract: The first part of the presentation will introduce our methodology towards improving molecular catalysts for energy relevant conversions. We strategically introduce redox-active and slightly acidic imidazolium moieties into the secondary coordination sphere of molecular CO2 reduction electrocatalysts. Results from systematic comparative studies will be presented that strongly suggest that mechanistic details of catalysis are altered for the new functionalized catalyst systems, resulting in improved catalytic metrics. The second part of the seminar will discuss our strategies to study intramolecular interactions between transition metal (TM) and lanthanide (Ln) ions to generate novel spin systems that can display single-molecule magnet (SMM) properties. SMMs are very attractive candidates for the miniaturization of tunable information storage materials and quantum computing devices. Our work aims to generate heterometallic SMMs that feature either TM\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Ln interactions or TM\u2011Ln bonding. I will present key results of our comprehensive structural and spectroscopic studies which have already led to the development of redox-switchable SMMs, new molecular platforms to facilitate strong magnetic coupling between Ln3+ ions, and hard SMM behavior. The \"2\" in CO2 is subscripted. \u00a0The \"3+\" in Ln3+ is superscripted.",

   "description": "Our sense of smell plays a central role in our interaction with the world around us. We can detect a vast number of individual and mixed odorants of diverse structure, informing our selection and enjoyment of food, alerting us to hazards, and even guiding our choice of a mate. In exploring the molecular basis of mammalian olfaction I select from both the worst- and best-smelling odorants: thiols and musks. While the vibration theory of olfaction (VTO) proposes that the unique thiol IR absorption at 2500 cm-1 is responsible for their characteristic odor, our work establishes that ionic copper plays a key role in the binding of sulfur compounds to mammalian olfactory receptors (ORs). While the VTO argues that deuterated compounds have different odors than their non-deuterated counterparts, our work using deuterated musks establishes that there is no difference in the binding of deuterated and non-deuterated odorants to ORs. We propose that the molecular basis of olfaction can best be explained by the docking theory of olfaction, involving weak noncovalent electrostatic, van der Waals, H-bonding, dipole\u2212dipole, pi\u2013pi, metal ion, pi-cation, and hydrophobic odorant-receptor interactions.",

   "description": "The increasing ubiquity of large-scale infrastructures for surveillance and data analysis has made understanding the impact of privacy a pressing priority. We propose a framework for studying a fundamental cost vs. privacy tradeoff in dynamic decision-making problems. The central question is: how can a decision maker take actions that are efficient for her goal, while simultaneously ensuring these actions do not inadvertently reveal her private information, even when observed and analyzed by a powerful adversary? We will examine two well-known decision problems (path planning and online learning), and in both cases establish sharp, information-theoretic complexity vs. privacy tradeoff. As a by-product, our analysis also leads to simple yet provably efficient algorithms for both the decision maker and eavesdropping adversary.

   "description": "Mechanics of fracture and failure of solids continues to elicit challenges in terms of modeling and simulation, and investigation of the physical mechanisms in a range of engineering, biological and geological materials like metals, polymers, and rocks. Here, I will give an overview of two major efforts in my group focusing on addressing the multiscale nature of fracture in two seemingly different but societally relevant applications: (1)Physics-based modeling of earthquake propagation on frictional interfaces , and (2) modeling of fracture in soft materials. In the first half of my talk, I will focus on a new computational algorithm for modeling earthquake ruptures with high resolution fault zone physics. I will present a hybrid method that combines Finite element method (FEM) and Spectral boundary integral (SBI) equation through the consistent exchange of displacement and traction boundary conditions, thereby benefiting from the flexibility of FEM in handling problems with nonlinearities or small-scale heterogeneities and from the superior performance and accuracy of SBI. I will present a verification of the hybrid method using a benchmark problem from the Southern California Earthquake Center\u2019s dynamic rupture simulation validation exercises and show that the method enables exact near field truncation of the elastodynamic solution. I will further demonstrate the capability and computational efficiency of the hybrid scheme for resolving off-fault complexities using a unique model of a fault zone with explicit representation of small scale secondary faults and branches enabling new insights into earthquake rupture dynamics that may not be realizable in homogenized isotropic plasticity or damage models. Next, I will briefly discuss our recent efforts in extending this method to consistently simulate sequences of seismic and aseismic slip in a fault zone by combining adaptive explicit and implicit integration schemes enabling us to vary the time step over more than seven orders of magnitude and to potentially explore the interplay between geometric, rheological, and frictional complexities over short and long time scales.",

The failure can also be one of effectiveness; the aircraft is technically successful as a flying machine, but is economically unviable or unable to perform its mission. The goal of the presentation is to describe the most common of these failure types and to provide, through historical example, insight enabling recognition and avoidance of the most common traps early in the design process.

   "description": "Abstract: Empirical applications of dynamic discrete choice models usually either take the discount factor to be known or rely on ad hoc functional form assumptions to identify and estimate it. We give identification results under economically motivated exclusion restrictions on primitive utilities. We show that each such exclusion restriction leads to an easily interpretable moment condition with the discount factor as the only unknown parameter. The identified set of discount factors that solves this condition is finite, but not necessarily a singleton. Consequently, in contrast to common intuition, an exclusion restriction does not provide point identification. In applications, multiple exclusion restrictions are often available. The discount factor can be set estimated from the corresponding moment conditions using existing methods without solving the choice model. Finally, we show that exclusion restrictions have nontrivial empirical content: The implied moment conditions impose restrictions on choices that are absent from the unconstrained model.

However, studies suggest that atmospheric models typically overestimate the abundance of tropospheric OH, which adversely impacts our ability to reliably estimate the atmospheric lifetime of carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), and other environmentally important trace gases. This talk will review the multi-decadal effort to better quantify the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere, starting with early space-based measurements of CO. I will discuss recent work to integrate the current suite of space-based observations of atmospheric composition using chemical data assimilation approaches to better quantify tropospheric OH.",

   "description": "Abstract : In the past decade, breath has become an increasingly explored bioanalyte for clinical biomarker discovery. Breath contains hundreds of volatile metabolic products from the body and can be sampled non-invasively for analysis at the point of care. However, since the first report of quantitative breath analysis by Linus Pauling in 1971, few robust breath biomarkers have been discovered and used in the clinic. In this talk, I will discuss an alternative approach to breath-based diagnostics using inhalable nanoparticles that we have engineered to release synthetic volatiles in response to aberrant protease activity in the lungs. The advantages of this approach are four-fold: (1) high sensitivity due to protease-driven readouts (2) high specificity through multiplexing (3) minimal background through use of biorthogonal volatile reporters and (4) a priori knowledge of the biological pathways driving breath signal. My interests lie in respiratory infections in which we can leverage both host and bacterial proteases. I will discuss my progress on this front and how this platform can be paired with machine learning to address clinical needs such as rapid pathogen identification.

   "description": "The Pasadena Folk Music Society is proud to present Jayme Stone and Folklife, a fine group of musicians who explore the deep roots music of North America and beyond. This is a completely new show, a follow-up to an earlier tour and album called the Lomax Project, which was performed here at Caltech with a slightly different line-up three years ago. They are touring the country, winding up in New York's Carnegie Hall in June. Jayme Stone is a Canadian banjo innovator, known for his bringing together diverse music, be it Bach or from Africa. His range is tremendous and his knowledge of the music insures that it will be an authentic rendering. The program treats old field recordings not as time capsules, but as heirloom seeds passed down from a bygone generation. Planting these sturdy seeds in modern soil, this versatile gathering of musicians\u2014 Moira Smiley , Sumaia Jackson and Joe Phillips \u2014has cultivated vibrant Sea Island spirituals, Creole calypsos, and stomp-down Appalachian dance tunes for contemporary listeners. Focusing on songs collected from field recordings at the Library of Congress, this ensemble preserves the essence of these fine recordings, while polishing them just a bit with contemporary nuances. Their recording based on this project, Jayme Stone's Folklife , was nominated for a Juno Award (Canada's Grammy equivalent) in the Traditional Roots Album of the Year category in 2018.

Although renowned internationally since its founding in 1991, Quatuor Danel did not perform in the U.S. until 2015. \"It's a wonder that a veteran chamber music group known throughout Europe doesn't perform here more often,\" according to DC Metro Theater Arts.

   "description": "Abstract : In this talk, I present my work on matching and pricing for ridesharing platforms, where drivers' strategic behavior (e.g. cherry-picking trips, and declining trips to chase surge prices) undercut their stated mission of providing transportation as reliable as running water.\" I introduce the Spatio-Temporal Pricing mechanism, which uses information about supply and demand over a planning horizon, solves for the welfare-optimal matching, and sets prices that are smooth\" in both space and time. In this way, the mechanism aligns incentives for drivers and promotes reliability without using penalties or time-extended contracts always accepting all trip dispatches forms a subgame-perfect equilibrium among the drivers. The mechanism also satisfies fairness properties, including that drivers at the same location and time do not envy each other's continuation payoffs. The mechanism is also robust, in that it achieves optimality along with other axiomatic properties from any history onward, including after a deviation. Simulation analysis suggests that the STP mechanism can achieve significantly higher social welfare than a myopic pricing mechanism. Bio : Hongyao Ma is a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science in the Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard, advised by Prof. David C. Parkes. Her research is broadly situated at the intersection of economics and computer science, and draws on concepts from multi-agent systems and game theory. She is particularly interested in designing market-based systems to bring people together in useful ways, in the presence of uncertainty, self-interest, and autonomy. Ma is a recipient of the Siebel Scholarship, Harvard SEAS fellowship, the UCLA-CSST scholarship, and the Derek Bok Center Certificate of Distinction in Teaching at Harvard. Ma received her M.S. in 2014 at Harvard, and B.E. in 2012 at Xi'an Jiaotong University, both in Electrical Engineering. She interned at Uber in the summer of 2017, visited Technion in the summer of 2016, worked as a research intern at AT&T Labs Research in the summer of 2013, and visited UCLA as a part of the CSST Program in 2011.

   "description": "Jonathan Simon , Associate Professor of Physics and The James Franck Institute and Fellow of the Institute for Molecular Engineering at the University of Chicago, will present a talk at the next KNI Distinguished Seminar on Tuesday, April 9th at 3 pm in 153 Noyes. Dr. Simon's lab explores the interface of condensed matter physics and quantum optics, employing tools from atomic physics, control theory, and state-of-the-art technology developed in-house. The group builds materials from light, investigates the role of topology in determining material properties, and tackles challenges at the crossroads between strong correlations and quantum coherence. Their research interests include: atomic physics, quantum optics, and feedback control, with a particular emphasis on the interface with quantum many-body physics. The group is presently exploring photonic quantum materials, photonic topological meta-materials, and hybridizing the two. Collaborative efforts include studies of circuit-QED-based quantum materials, as well as interfacing mm-wave and optical photons through Rydberg atoms. More information willl be available in the coming weeks. The KNI Distinguished Seminar Series is a new monthly series hosted by The Kavli Nanoscience Institute where eminent scientists and thinkers with strong yet varied backgrounds in nanoscience and nanotechnology share their expertise with the Caltech community. Seminars consist of a one-hour presentation, followed by a Q&A and light reception. The scopes of presentations may range from: recent outstanding scientific highlights/technological advancements, to innovative early-stage research developments, to broader cross-disciplinary topics that are relevant to nanoscience. Each seminar will be recorded and made available to the public via the KNI's YouTube page .",

   "description": "I introduce a polling stage to Feddersen and Pesendorfer's (1996) two-candidate election model in which some voters are uncertain about the state of the world. While Feddersen and Pesendorfer find that less informed, indifferent voters strictly prefer abstention, which they refer to as the swing voter's curse, I show that there exists an equilibrium in which everyone truthfully reveals his/her preference in the poll and participates in voting. Moreover, I find that even in the truth-telling equilibrium, the candidate who wins the poll may be defeated in the election. In a large election, however, polls can still help information aggregation.",

Roughly speaking, these principles assert that your current opinions should cohere with your anticipated future opinions. I will show that both principles can be justified by three types of arguments, which are based on expected accuracy, diachronic coherence, and the value of information. Together these arguments establish reflection and martingale principles as important guides to rational learning.",

Examples of FDA-approved biologics include therapeutic proteins (e.g. blood clotting factors and antibodies), engineered viruses for gene therapy, and cell therapies. Biologics are addressing previous unmet medical needs, but are challenging to manufacture and therefore high in cost. In this talk, I will describe our efforts to develop synthetic alternatives to biologics used in medicine. In the first example, a multivalent polymer displaying a fibrin-binding peptide was developed as a synthetic alternative to recombinant proteins used in trauma medicine. The second example, a polymer that facilitates intracellular delivery of nucleic acids and peptides was synthesized based on design principles learned from adenoviral vectors. In a final example, a unique aptamer with high affinity for T cell marker CD8 was discovered and applied as an alternative to antibodies for T cell isolation in the manufacturing process for CAR T cells.",

   "description": "Neuronal circuit architecture and directional connectivity determine functionality, communication, and computation in the brain. The development of microfluidics and microfabrication technologies made it possible to develop compartmentalized lab-on-chip platforms to grow and manipulate neuronal networks, to address specific questions extending from axonal guidance, synapse formation, or axonal transport, to the development of 2D/3D models for deciphering pathophysiological pathways, or for pharmacological testing and drug screening. This novel approach can be used for almost any type of neuronal circuits or brain disorders and is enabling new insights into neurobiological events previously unachievable through traditional cell biology techniques. Our team provided the first proof of concept that neuronal populations could be connected in a directional manner by controlling axonal outgrowth through physical constraints using asymmetrical microchannels to guide axons. These \"neuronal diodes\", can be established with primary neurons from different regions of the brain (e.g. cortex, striatum, hippocampus) and with human neurons obtained by cell-reprogramming (hiPSCs). The technology is adaptable to many experimental settings and readouts, and to parallelization for high-content screening. It has also many applications including the potential to accurately model acute and chronic neurodegeneration. I will present applications of the neuronal diodes to model Alzheimer\u2019s Disease on chip, as part of a drug discovery strategy that led us to found a critical role of the cysteine protease Caspase-2 and to validate on-chip a newly designed selective Caspase-2 inhibitor. Biography: Etienne Jacotot is Research Director at Inserm (Paris, France). He received a B.Sc. in molecular biology and genetics from University Paris 11 Orsay in 1993 and M.Sc. and PhD in immunology from Institut Pasteur and University Paris 11 in 1994 and 1997. He did a post-doctoral training in the Guido Kroemer's lab, where he discovered a mitochondrial target for the HIV-1 Viral protein R, described the role of mitochondria and caspases in HIV Env-mediated syncytial apoptosis, and contributed to the characterization of mitochondrial Apoptosis-Inducing Factor. In 2001, he cofounded and directed for 8 years a VC-funded biotech company where he settled mitochondria-based phenotypic screening platforms, identified Caspase-2 as a target in neonatal brain damage, and managed the preclinical development of a neuroprotective drug candidate. After a Visiting Professor position at Imperial College London (UK) from 2009 to 2014, he joined IBPS - Sorbonne University. His research group develop translational approaches to target Caspase-2 and develops neurofluidic microsystems to control the architecture of neuronal circuits in vitro, in a translational perspective. He contributed to 78 research publications (Hindex = 36; citations: > 10 150) and he is named inventor of 28 patent applications.

   "description": "NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, one of the four great NASA Observatories, observes the universe in the infrared. It essentially operates as an enormous pair of night-vision goggles, allowing it to perceive invisible \"heat\" radiation and pierce through dust clouds, something impossible for visible light. Because of its unique view of the sky, Spitzer has achieved major discoveries in almost every area of astrophysics. It has detected some of the oldest galaxies in our universe, discovered a new ring around Saturn, and observed the seven Earth-sized planets in the TRAPPIST-1 exoplanetary system. Now, after 16 years of continuous operation, well exceeding its planned 2.5-year primary mission duration, Spitzer is set to retire in the next year. Come discover the universe in the infrared and the remarkable legacy the NASA Spitzer Space Telescope has provided. About the Series Stargazing Lectures are free lectures at a public level followed by guided stargazing with telescopes (weather permitting). All events are held at the Cahill Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics at Caltech. No reservations are needed. Lectures are 30 minutes; stargazing lasts 90 minutes. Stay only as long as you want. Stargazing is only possible with clear skies, but the lecture, slideshow, and Q&A takes place regardless of weather.

   "description": "Award-winning author Jessica Shattuck will discuss her New York Times bestselling novel, The Women in the Castle . The book tells the story of three German widows living together in a crumbling castle in Bavaria in the immediate aftermath of World War II. While their husbands were executed for their participation in the July 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler, the women\u2019s own beliefs and experiences span the gamut of the German political spectrum. It is as much about complicity as it is about resistance and offers a new and different look at WWII from the German point of view. Shattuck, who is herself of German descent, will share how she came to write the book and what she learned in her research about this time in history. Shattuck\u2019s other novels include Perfect Life and The Hazards of Good Breeding , which was a New York Times Notable Book, a Boston Globe Book of the Year, and a finalist for the 2003 PEN/Winship Award. Her fiction has appeared in The New Yorker , Glamour , Open City , and The Tampa Review among other publications. Her nonfiction has appeared in The New York Times , Mother Jones , Wired , The Believer Magazine , and The Boston Globe .",

   "description": "Abstract : Superconducting circuits have emerged as one of the leading platforms for realizing a universal quantum computer. They are relatively easy to design, simulate, and fabricate, and their coherence times have improved enormously over the past decade. However, to date there still does not exist a clear technology roadmap for building a fault-tolerant computer due to several challenges. An error-corrected processor with even a relatively small number of logical qubits (~100) will require orders of magnitude many more physical qubits than anything demonstrated to date. So a first challenge is that, because resonant electromagnetic circuits operating at microwave frequencies have large footprints, the space available to fabricate them on a chip is severely limited. In addition each qubit generally requires several lines for readout and control, so wiring a chip at the bottom of a dilution refrigerator quickly becomes intractable. Here I propose to alleviate these challenges by integrating superconducting qubits with nanomechanical resonators, using the latter as ultracompact quantum memories. I will first present an architecture in which a single superconducting qubit coupled to several resonators can be used to sequentially perform one and two qubit gates between any pair of them, turning the original qubit into a \u2018module\u2019 with a much larger Hilbert space. I will then present the first experimental demonstration of direct, resonant coupling between a superconducting circuit and a phononic crystal defect cavity (PCDC), a nanostructure which localizes sound waves at a single defect site in an artificial lattice. I will also show new results demonstrating strong coupling of a transmon qubit to an array of PCDCs with localized resonances in the gigahertz range. I will conclude with a discussion on how this platform additionally enables new demonstrations in quantum acoustics such as non-demolition detection of single phonons and generation of Schr\u00f6dinger cat states. Bio : Patricio ArrangoizArriola is a PhD candidate in Applied Physics at Stanford University, working in the group of Amir SafaviNaeini. He received a Bachelor\u2019s in Physics from Caltech in 2014, where he worked under the supervision of Paul Bellan and Axel Scherer. His doctoral research is on developing hybrid approaches to scaling up superconducting quantum computing technologies. As part of these efforts he worked on techniques to model and simulate the interaction of superconducting qubits and piezoelectric nanostructures and developed a set of fabrication processes to integrate these two technologies on a single chip. His work with lithium niobate has enabled the creation of new nanoscale devices that were previously inaccessible with this material, including phononic and optomechanical crystals directly wired to superconducting circuits. He also contributes to a number of other efforts in the group, including microwave-to-optical conversion of single photons with lithium niobate modulators and various experiments in circuit quantum electrodynamics.

The training helps you identify the signs and symptoms of common mental health concerns such as depression, anxiety, addiction, psychosis, and trauma. This class does not train you to be a therapist or intervene, but rather you will learn how to have supportive conversations and refer individuals of concern to appropriate resources. Mental Health First Aid will be offered once during Spring term in two sessions on April 17 and April 24th. You must attend both classes on 4/17 and 4/24 to receive the MHFA certificate and manual .

   "description": "While small molecules offer a unique opportunity to target structural and regulatory elements in therapeutically relevant RNAs, selectivity has been a recurrent challenge in small molecule:RNA recognition.\u00a0 In particular, RNAs tend to be more dynamic and offer less chemical functionality than proteins, and biologically active ligands must compete with the highly abundant and highly structured RNA of the ribosome. Indeed, no small molecule drugs targeting RNAs other than the ribosome are currently available, and our recent survey of the literature revealed little more than one hundred reported chemical probes that target non-ribosomal RNA in biological systems. As part of our efforts to improve small molecule targeting strategies and gain fundamental insights into small molecule:RNA recognition, we are analyzing patterns in both RNA-biased small molecule chemical space and RNA topological space privileged for differentiation. To begin, we identified physicochemical, structural, and spatial properties of biologically active RNA ligands that are distinct from those of protein-targeted ligands. Elaboration of four RNA binding scaffolds into a library enriched with these properties has led to improved recognition of medicinally relevant RNA targets, including viral and long noncoding RNA structures. At the same time, we used pattern recognition protocols to identify RNA topologies that can be differentially recognized by small molecules and have elaborated this technique to visualize conformational changes in RNA secondary structure. We are currently expanding these studies with the ultimate goal of applying these insights to the rapid development of ligands with high affinity and specificity for a wide range of RNA targets, particularly those critical to cancer progression.",

This conformable, stretchable, self-healable and biodegradable material simultaneously collects signals from external stimuli that translate into information such as pressure, pain, and temperature. The development of electronic materials, inspired by the complexity of this organ is a tremendous, unrealized materials challenge. However, the advent of organic-based electronic materials may offer a potential solution to this longstanding problem. In this talk, I will describe the design of organic electronic materials to mimic skin functions.

   "description": "We pursue in a multi-dimensional approach the quantification of weak intermolecular interactions in chemical and biological systems. Examples discussed in the lecture are orthogonal dipolar interactions, organofluorine interactions, substituent effects on \u03c0-\u03c0-stacking interactions, halogen bonding, and chalcogen bonding. Enantioselective complexation based solely on dispersion interactions and perfect shape complementarity is achieved with new chiral alleno-acetylenic cage compounds. We also explore the energetics of the replacement of conserved water molecules in protein co-crystal structures by ligand parts, with a particular interest in cyclic water clusters. Lessons learned are directly applicable to ligand design and optimization in drug discovery and crop protection research, but equally to the assembly of synthetic supramolecular systems. The approach is illustrated in examples taken from our structure-based drug design projects. Specific examples for investigations of protein-ligand interactions include (i) addressing the Gly-rich ATP-triphosphate-binding loop of protein kinase A (PKA), (ii) complexation at the allosteric site of IspD, an enzyme from the non-mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis and deciphering of the allosteric mechanism, (iii) halogen-bonding at the active site of the cysteine protease hCatL, and (iv) ligand development against a novel target for antimalarials, serine hydroxymethyl transferase (SHMT), a key enzyme from the folate biosynthesis cycle.",

   "description": "Chen-Huang Sustainability Series Lecture: The California Experience Goes Global with Terry Tamminen, CEO of the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation Monday, April 22, 2019 | Ramo Auditorium 5:00 to 6:00 pm | Refreshments before starting at 4:30 pm About the Lecture In this presentation, former CalEPA Secretary Terry Tamminen examines California sustainability policies that succeeded in the state (including \"lessons learned\" and setbacks), but which also became models around the globe for advancing environmental protection and \"green\" economic development. He will also present a roadmap for policies and projects that could simultaneously save endangered species (and their habitats), address climate change, and create the biggest wealth-generating opportunity of the 21st Century. About the Speaker Terry has deep international expertise in business, agriculture, education, public policy and the environment. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger appointed him Secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency and later Cabinet Secretary, the Chief Policy Advisor to the Governor, where Terry was the architect of many groundbreaking sustainability policies, including California's landmark Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, the Hydrogen Highway Network, and the Million Solar Roofs initiative. In 2010 Terry co-founded the R20 Regions of Climate Action, a public-private partnership bringing together subnational governments, businesses, financial markets, NGOs, and academia to implement measurable, large-scale, low-carbon and climate resilient economic development projects that can simultaneously solve the climate crisis and build a sustainable global economy. Since 2007 he has provided advice to Pegasus Capital Advisors and numerous global businesses on sustainability and \"green\" investing. In 2016, Terry joined the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation as CEO. An accomplished author, Terry's books include \"Cracking the Carbon Code: The Keys to Sustainable Profits in the New Economy\" (Palgrave Macmillan). In 2011, Terry was one of six finalists for the Zayed Future Energy Prize and The Guardian ranked Terry No. 1 in its \"Top 50 People Who Can Save the Planet.\" This event is free and open to the public. No RSVP required. Seating is on a first-come, first-seated basis. The Chen-Huang Sustainability Series is made possible by the generous support of Dr. Marina Chen (MS '80 CS; PhD '83 CS) and Chi-Fu Huang.",

   "description": "Low clouds over subtropical oceans cool Earth's climate because they reflect most of the sunlight shining on them back to space. It is unclear, however, how the clouds themselves change with climate; this gives rise to large uncertainties in climate change projections. Tapio Schneider's lecture will show how advances in computing and satellite observations are enabling breakthroughs in the accuracy of climate projections. Such advances have already revealed a tipping point of the climate system: if greenhouse gas concentrations rise high enough, subtropical low clouds may melt away, triggering dramatic global warming. This event is free; no tickets or reservations are required. A minimum of 700 seats will be available on a first-come, first-served basis, beginning at 7:30 p.m. Reserved section tickets are available to members of The Friends of Beckman Auditorium and the Caltech Associates , and to Caltech alumni . About the Speaker Tapio Schneider is the Theodore Y. Wu Professor of Environmental Science and Engineering at Caltech in the Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences ; and Jet Propulsion Laboratory Senior Research Scientist. About the Series Since 1922, The Earnest C. Watson Lecture Series has has brought Caltech's most innovative scientific research to the public. The series is named for Earnest C. Watson, a professor of physics at Caltech from 1919 until 1959. Spotlighting a small selection of the pioneering research Caltech's faculty is currently conducting, the Watson Lectures are geared toward a general audience, as part of the Institute's ongoing commitment to benefiting the local community through education and outreach. Through a gift from the estate of Richard C. Biedebach, the lecture series is able to highlight an assistant professor's research each season. DOWNLOAD THE SERIES BROCHURE Find Us On Facebook",

The training helps you identify the signs and symptoms of common mental health concerns such as depression, anxiety, addiction, psychosis, and trauma. This class does not train you to be a therapist or intervene, but rather you will learn how to have supportive conversations and refer individuals of concern to appropriate resources. Mental Health First Aid will be offered once during Spring term. You must also have attended the previous class on 4/17 to receive the MHFA certificate and manual .

   "description": "Steve Hetts, MD:  Dr. Hetts received his MD from Harvard Medical School and his undergraduate degree from Harvard College. He completed his medical internship at Stanford and his diagnostic radiology residency, diagnostic neuroradiology fellowship, and interventional neuroradiology fellowship at UCSF, where he joined the faculty in 2008.\r\nAs Co-Director of the Interventional Radiology Research Laboratory, Dr. Hetts is involved in translating basic science and engineering research into clinical applicability. The main theme of his research is development of novel image-guided endovascular devices and techniques for the treatment of stroke, tumors, vascular malformations, and other conditions accessible through the blood vessels or skin. He has been the principal investigator on an NIH-sponsored project to develop remote-controlled endovascular catheters for use in interventional MRI. This could revolutionize stroke treatment, allowing doctors to visualize living versus dead brain tissue in real-time during their surgeries. He is also the principal investigator on an NIH-sponsored project to develop an endovascular filtration device to reduce systemic toxicity during intraarterial chemotherapy for a variety of tumors. Such a device could not only reduce the side-effects of chemotherapy, but also enable better tumor control and, in some cases, cure. \r\nSteven Hetts is Chief of Interventional Neuroradiology at the UCSF Mission Bay Hospitals, where he provides cutting-edge, minimally invasive endovascular therapy for children and adults with stroke, cerebrovascular disease and tumors, including retinoblastoma. He founded the Interventional Neuroradiology services at San Francisco General Hospital and the San Francisco Veteran's Administration Hospital, where he served as Chief until 2015.  https://profiles.ucsf.edu/steven.hetts#narrative\r\n\r\nAnand S. Patel, MD: Dr. Patel is Chief of Interventional Radiology at Providence Little Company of Mary Torrance and San Pedro Hospitals. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania obtaining a degree in Bioengineering.  He then completed his MD at Harvard Medical School, and an internal medicine internship at Beth Israel Deaconess.  Dr. Patel completed his Radiology residency and Vascular & Interventional Fellowship at the University of California at San Francisco. His interests lie in interventional oncology (minimally invasive cancer treatments), women's health, interventional pain, peripheral arterial disease, venous disease, and MRI. Dr. Patel has been named a top doctor by Los Angeles Magazine.\r\n\r\nDr. Patel aims to stay on the forefront of medical innovations, and is currently an Assistant Visiting Professor of Radiology at UCSF. He is a former CEO/Co-Founder of an NIH/National Cancer Institute funded med device startup for safer cost-effective liver cancer treatment. Dr. Patel works with leading organizations to create new technologies. Currently, he is working to develop a novel artificial intelligence tool to improve radiology cancer detection. Dr. Patel has diverse interests in health IT, policy, and entrepreneurship with the aim of improving patient care in a cost-effective manner. He has developed rapid MRI techniques at Harvard/MIT, and at UCSF was the Coordinator for the RSNA Image Share Network - a national informatics endeavor enabling patients to share their medical images via the cloud. Dr. Patel was also the past-President of the California Radiological Society Residents/Fellows Section. http://www.advancedimagingsouthbay.com/dr-anand-patel.html",

   "description": "Abstract : The study of vehicles traveling at hypersonic speeds is extremely complex and involves many physical processes occurring over a broad range of time-scales. Advances in both computational chemistry and computational power have enabled the construction of extremely detailed models for chemical non-equilibrium effects based on ab initio quantum chemistry data, referred to as the State-to-State (StS) model. Unfortunately, due to the enormous cost of both computing data for and applying the StS model, it can only be applied to highly simplified test cases. This motivates the development of reduced order models for chemical non-equilibrium which can capture the same physics at a reduced computational cost. The model reduction framework presented, based on the maximum-entropy principle, provides a link between the ab initio quantum chemistry data and computational fluid dynamics. The objective of this work is twofold: first to present a model reduction framework for application to chemical non-equilibrium based on fundamental physics principles; and second, to use this framework to study thermochemical non-equilibrium in a variety of conditions for a gas composed of nitrogen molecules. Bio : Robyn Macdonald received her B.S. in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2013, and will receive her PhD from UIUC in May 2019 under the guidance of Prof. Marco Panesi. She is currently a post-doctoral research fellow at the University of Minnesota working under Prof. Graham Candler. Her PhD researched focused on the development of quantum chemistry informed reduced order models for thermochemical non-equilibrium hypersonic flows. Her PhD research was supported by the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship, and her post-doctoral research is supported by the President's Postdoctoral Fellowship Program at the University of Minnesota.

   "description": "The US department of defense tracks approximately 26000 resident space objects ranging from the size of a softball to a school bus. From these, roughly 2000 are actively controlled and all else are effectively space garbage. As such, they do not transmit their identities making them more difficult to track. Tracking is understood as both detecting and object and positively identifying it. Most of these objects are measured as point detection (i.e. non-resolved). Astrodynamics is the science that studies motion of resident space objects. There are four field effects driving RSO motion: gravitational, radiative, particulates, and geomagnetic. Of these, only the gravitational field effects are independent of the RSO\u2019s physical characteristics. The question then is, how do we positively identify all of the RSOs in the population and thus improve our ability to predict their behavior to satisfy a growing need for space safety, security, and sustainability? How do we deal with uncertainty comprised of both randomness and ignorance? Dr. Jah will describe current state of practice, compare this to state of the art, and identify scientific and engineering gaps that are in need of being satisfied. He will also provide a summary of his research program at UT Austin and how this focus area fits into a larger vision of rigorous and comprehensive space situational awareness and space traffic management.",

These color centers act as artificial atoms in the solid state, and can have remarkable optical and spin properties. We aim to explore fundamental device physics, materials engineering, and nanophotonics to gain full control over color centers to build them into scalable quantum devices, with the large-scale technological goals of realizing quantum networks and nanoscale sensors. Complementarily, we will search for new color centers for applications in quantum information processing and quantum sensing. In the near term, this toolkit will enable the exploration of fundamental quantum optics, magnetic interactions, and many body physics. Our lab is highly interdisciplinary, spanning optics and photonics, surface science and materials engineering, atomic and molecular spectroscopy, nanofabrication, and cryogenics. More information willl be available in the coming weeks. The KNI Distinguished Seminar Series is a new monthly series hosted by The Kavli Nanoscience Institute where eminent scientists and thinkers with strong yet varied backgrounds in nanoscience and nanotechnology share their expertise with the Caltech community. Seminars consist of a one-hour presentation, followed by a Q&A and light reception. The scopes of presentations may range from: recent outstanding scientific highlights/technological advancements, to innovative early-stage research developments, to broader cross-disciplinary topics that are relevant to nanoscience. Each seminar will be recorded and made available to the public via the KNI's YouTube page .",

   "description": "Abstract : Fluid-driven crack propagation concerns several areas of engineering, including structural, geotechnical, and petroleum engineering. The development of simulation tools for pressurized cracks propagating in realistic scenarios needs to tackle the complexity arising from the non-linear hydro-mechanical coupling of the fluid and the cracked solid in a suitable framework for large-scale applications. In this lecture, I will introduce the governing equations of hydraulic fracture and discuss well-known propagation regimes where the problem can be treated analytically. I will then present a computational approach to model the hydro-mechanical coupling of the fracturing solid and the fluid flow inside the propagating cracks. Benchmarks in 2D and 3D demonstrate the capability of the computational framework to successfully deal with a priori unknown and arbitrarily intricate crack paths, and with the need for large-scale simulations. Time permitting, I will describe other recent eorts in developing advanced next-generation computational algorithms for large-scale simulation of complex material response, including mechanical instabilities and material failure. Bio : Bianca Giovanardi is a Postdoctoral Associate in Computational Solid Mechanics in the group of Prof. Raul Radovitzky at the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at MIT. Her current research interests encompass next-generation computational models for failure analysis of solids under extreme loading in a variety of fields, including geophysics, aerospace, and defense. She earned her PhD in Computational Mathematics in 2017 from the Politecnico di Milano with a thesis proposing a novel method to simulate crack propagation in brittle materials. During her PhD, she was awarded a Roberto Rocca Doctoral Fellowship, which allowed her to spend six months at MIT developing high performance simulation tools for fluid-driven fracture propagation. When not coding or debugging, Bianca enjoys going on hikes, sailing and practicing water polo. This lecture is part of the Young Investigators Lecture Series sponsored by the Caltech Division of Engineering & Applied Science.",

   "description": "Professor Chien's research on how blood flow regulates interaction between the blood stream, blood cells and artery walls also leads to new information relevant to other types of cells, e.g., stem cells and cancer cells. At the molecular level, he is discovering how mechanical forces signal gene expression to cause cell growth, migration and cell death. Chien takes a multidisciplinary, integrative approach that combines engineering and biomedical sciences. He employs an array of technologies including nanotechnology, DNA microarrary, bioinformatics, cell biophysics and biomechanics in his research on the cardiovascular system.. https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/faculty/faculty_bios/index.sfe?fmp_recid=11\r\n\r\nBiography: Shu Chien joined UCSD in 1988 and became the founding chair of the Department of Bioengineering in 1994. In 2008, Chien became the founding Director of UC San Diego's new Institute of Engineering in Medicine to foster collaborations among the faculty of UCSD and with research institutes and biomedical companies in San Diego. As principal investigator on the Whitaker Foundation Development Award (1993) and Leadership Award (1998), Chien played a major role in establishing UCSD' bioengineering program as one of the top programs in the country. As founding Director of the UC Systemwide Bioengineering Institute in California, he has contributed to collaborations in research and education among the ten UC campuses. In September 2006, Chien was named the inaugural holder of the Y.C. Fung Endowed Chair in Bioengineering at the Jacobs School. He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences, and American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Chien won the US National Medal of Science in 2011. He received his M.D. from the National Taiwan University and his Ph.D. in Physiology from Columbia University, where he was a professor from 1969 to 1988. http://iem.ucsd.edu/",

   "description": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex assembly of structural proteins that provides physical support and biochemical signaling to cells in tissues. Over the last two decades, studies have revealed the important role that ECM elasticity plays in regulating a variety of biological processes in cells, including stem cell differentiation and cancer progression. However, tissues and ECM are often viscoelastic, displaying stress relaxation over time in response to a deformation. My group has been focused on elucidating the impact of ECM viscoelasticity on cells. Our approach involves the use engineered biomaterials for 3D culture, in which the mechanical properties can be independently modulated. In this talk, I will discuss our recent findings on how chondrocytes and stem cells sense ECM viscoelasticity, how cancer cells generate force to divide in growing tumors, and on mechanical regulation of breast cancer invasion.",

   "description": "Stars are the building blocks of galaxies and home to the planets. We must understand how stars form to explain many other aspects of the Universe, yet many mysteries remain about this complex process. Starting from the Big Bang, I will walk us through the chain of events that we know had to happen to produce a star like our Sun in a galaxy like the Milky Way. Then, I will talk about the main things we don't know: why do the stars form in the quantity that they do? Why is the typical mass of a newborn star the same everywhere we have looked? And why is star formation so slow? I will show how observations and theory are working together to answer these fundamental questions about how a star is born. About the Series Stargazing Lectures are free lectures at a public level followed by guided stargazing with telescopes (weather permitting). All events are held at the Cahill Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics at Caltech. No reservations are needed. Lectures are 30 minutes; stargazing lasts 90 minutes. Stay only as long as you want. Stargazing is only possible with clear skies, but the lecture, slideshow, and Q&A takes place regardless of weather.

   "description": "X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES or NEXAFS) is a powerful technique for electronic structure determination.\u00a0 However, widespread use of XANES is limited by the need for synchrotron light sources with tunable x-ray energy. Recent developments in extreme ultraviolet (XUV) light sources using the laser-based technique of high-harmonic generation have enabled core-level spectroscopy to be performed on femtosecond to attosecond timescales.\u00a0 We have extended the scope of tabletop XUV spectroscopy and demonstrated that M2,3-edge XANES, corresponding to 3p\u21923d transitions, can reliably measure the electronic structure of first-row transition metal coordination complexes with femtosecond time resolution.\u00a0 We use this ability to track the excited-state relaxation pathways of photocatalysts and spin crossover complexes.\u00a0 In semiconductors such as CH3NH3PbI3, distinct signals are observed for photoinduced electrons and holes, allowing the dynamics of each carrier to be tracked independently.\u00a0 This work establishes extreme ultraviolet spectroscopy as a useful tool for mainstream research in inorganic, organometallic, and materials chemistry. Please Note: The \"2,3\" in M2,3-edge is subscripted; the \"3\" in CH3NH3Pbl3 is subscripted.",

Within this regime we have exploited cooperative Lewis base/transition metal catalysis as an effective means to control and direct both reaction partners during\u00a0 bond construction. The versatility of this approach is such that each catalyst acts in an orthogonal manner, which permits the role and function of the metal center to be modified and tuned without compromising enantioselectivity. This seminar will describe our most recent efforts in asymmetric carbon\u2013carbon\u00a0 and carbon-nitrogen bond formation.",

   "description": "Sugars, also called glycans, are one of the four major classes of macromolecules that make up living systems (along with proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids). Glycans assemble into complex structures on the surfaces of cells, forming a thick, fuzzy coating that surrounds cells and modulates the ability of cells to communicate (with other cells). In her lecture, Linda Hsieh- Wilson will describe the development of new tools to help researchers uncover the roles of glycans in the brain, including their participation in neurological and psychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer's and autism. This event is free; no tickets or reservations are required. A minimum of 700 seats will be available on a first-come, first-served basis, beginning at 7:30 p.m. Reserved section tickets are available to members of The Friends of Beckman Auditorium and the Caltech Associates , and to Caltech alumni . About the Speaker Linda C. Hsieh-Wilson is the Arthur and Marian Hanisch Memorial Professor of Chemistry at Caltech in the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering . About the Series Since 1922, The Earnest C. Watson Lecture Series has has brought Caltech's most innovative scientific research to the public. The series is named for Earnest C. Watson, a professor of physics at Caltech from 1919 until 1959. Spotlighting a small selection of the pioneering research Caltech's faculty is currently conducting, the Watson Lectures are geared toward a general audience, as part of the Institute's ongoing commitment to benefiting the local community through education and outreach. Through a gift from the estate of Richard C. Biedebach, the lecture series is able to highlight an assistant professor's research each season. DOWNLOAD THE SERIES BROCHURE Find Us On Facebook",

   "description": "Abstract : Monodisperse micro-particles are crucial in medical/pharmaceutical applications and environmental assessment. Yet, given different particle-size-distributions in the original suspension, variations in the system design are required in many of the existing separation techniques (e.g. membrane filtration, microfluidic devices). In this talk, I will introduce a clog-free and cost-effective method to separate different polydisperse suspensions without changing the system set-up, simply using the interface of a bubble confined in a millimeter scale capillary. The particle and interface interaction will be introduced, which serves as the prerequisite condition for particle separation, followed by the critical dimension and particle separation criteria. Finally, with the time-dependent features of a confined bubble, we will be able to tune the separation criteria in-situ, and obtain multiple particle distribution functions (PDFs) in one single separation process. Bio : Estella Yu is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Princeton University, advised by Prof. Howard A. Stone. She received her B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Boston University. Estella is working in the Complex Fluids Group, whose research is built around multiphase flows, colloid science, physical chemistry, biophysics, etc. Estella\u2019s work has focused on multiphase flows and thin films, where she aims to develop an efficient and cost-effective separation technique by combining the results from analysis, experiments and simulations.

   "description": "Abstract : A paradox of modern biology is that while metabolism is known to influence epigenetic signals (including, but not limited to histone acetylation), the specific proteins that sense these metabolic cues remain uncharacterized. Here we describe the utility of chemical methods to discover novel epigenetic mechanisms and characterize their metabolic regulation. Our initial studies have led to the identification of novel metabolic inhibitors of histone acetyltransferases, an expanded landscape of regulatory acetylation in gene expression control, and new signaling functions of the covalent oncometabolite fumarate. Through our efforts, we aim to define novel biological pathways which influence the development, progression, and treatment of cancer. Bio : Dr. Meier received his undergraduate degree in chemistry from Creighton University in 2004, getting introduced to research as an National Science Foundation REU student. Following graduation he moved to the University of California-San Diego, performing graduate research in natural products biochemistry and proteomics under the mentorship of Professor Michael D. Burkart. After receiving his Ph.D. in chemistry in 2009, he moved to the California Institute of Technology. His research as an American Cancer Society postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Professor Peter B. Dervan focused on the development of high-throughput sequencing methods to analyze small molecule-DNA interactions. In 2013, Dr. Meier joined the NCI, where his research focuses on the development of synthetic probes to investigate metabolic and epigenetic signaling pathways in cancer.",

   "description": "A scarce two decades ago, the idea of other worlds around other stars, inhabited by other beings, lived in the realms of philosophy and science fiction. And yet here we stand today, counting these distant planets in the thousands, and slowly peering down through their atmospheres to answer questions about their habitability. It is staggering to think that this exoplanet revolution is happening in our lifetimes \u2014 that we will be remembered as the generation that discovered other worlds. The question now becomes, will we also be the first ones to find life in the Universe beyond Earth? About the Series Stargazing Lectures are free lectures at a public level followed by guided stargazing with telescopes (weather permitting). All events are held at the Cahill Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics at Caltech. No reservations are needed. Lectures are 30 minutes; stargazing lasts 90 minutes. Stay only as long as you want. Stargazing is only possible with clear skies, but the lecture, slideshow, and Q&A takes place regardless of weather.

   "description": "USC\u2019s population consists of 17% of first-generation college students. For USC, this is a stepping stone; however, USC has often failed to provide the necessary resources and guidance that first-generation students need in order to more easily navigate the college system.\u00a0\n\r\nThe recent admission scandals reminded first-generation college students of the many inequities that exist amongst the undergraduate student body. Not only are first-generation college students responsible for figuring out how to get access to higher education, but they are also left with the burden of navigating the system once they get in\u2014a system that was not built for them.\n\r\nAs the community of first-generation students continues to grow\u00a0at USC, so does the need for more resources for this specific community. For instance, previous USC student leaders have advocated for additional resources, such as the need for physical space (first gen office), more first gen scholarships, and more program initiatives. In the past, the concerns of the community have not been taken into serious consideration and have often been overlooked.\u00a0\n\r\nTherefore, the First Generation Student Union invites the USC community to stand in solidarity with the First Generation community. Now, more than ever, it is crucial to rally for empowerment and to remind USC that they are not just another statistic, and that first-generation college students do belong. The rally will provide an opportunity for first-gen students to voice their concerns, share their experiences, as well as provide space for allies to show their support.\u00a0\n\r\nThe first generation college students are here, we care, and we invite the administration to hear students\u2019 concerns and goals for the future.\n\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact:\r\nValentin Avila, avilaval@usc.edu\r\nMiriam Antonio, mantonio@usc.edu\n",

   "description": "Two hundred years ago, on a dark and stormy night in Switzerland, a group of young English intellectuals challenged one another to invent a frightening story. \nEighteen-year-old Mary Shelley\u2014the daughter of political philosopher William Godwin and pioneering feminist writer Mary Wollstonecraft\u2014devised the most horrific tale, which in its many forms forever altered and continually haunts the landscape of literature and popular imagination.\nConsidered among the first sci-fi stories in the form of a novel,\u00a0Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus,\u00a0documents the consequences of Victor Frankenstein\u2019s quest to assemble from corpses and reanimate a creature of his own design. \nOn display here are illustrated versions of the novel, several representations of the many new creations, re-creations, and miscreations of Frankenstein\u2019s creature that followed the original, and examples of the scientific and literary works that inspired Shelley.\u00a0\nTo celebrate the bicentennial anniversary of Frankenstein\u2019s publication, the USC Libraries are partnering with Visions & Voices and schools across campus for a live, multimedia performance on April 4 at 7:30 p.m. on the front steps of Doheny Memorial Library.

Protein deamidation is the simplest post-translational modification and interestingly is catalyzed by a group of key metabolic enzymes known as glutamine amidotransferases. Herpesviruses encode pseudoenzymes or bona fide deamidases to promote deamidation and regulate fundamental biological processes, thus providing excellent model systems to interrogate roles of protein damidation. \nCurrently, research in Dr. Feng\u2019s laboratory is directed to probe the biological function of deamidation in coupling fundamental biological processes to metabolic status. Dr. Feng\u2019s research is primarily supported by grants from NIDCR, NCI and NIAID. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n",

   "description": "Dr. Katie Witkiewitz is a Regents\u2019 Professor of Psychology at the University of New Mexico with a joint appointment at the Center on Alcoholism, Substance Abuse, and Addictions. The underlying theme of her research is the development of empirically-based models of addiction, with an emphasis on applying advanced quantitative research methods to better understand changes in addictive behavior over time. \nDr. Witkiewitz is also a licensed clinical psychologist and has worked extensively on the development of a theoretical model of biopsychosocial influences on alcohol and drug relapse. She has conducted numerous empirical studies on the prediction of alcohol and drug relapse following treatment for substance use disorders, mechanisms of successful alcohol treatment outcomes, as well as the development of interventions to treat addiction. \nHer research has been supported by grants from the National Institute on Mental Health, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the National Cancer Institute, totaling over $20 million in research funding since 2004. \u00a0\u00a0\nAlcohol use is highly prevalent in society and, yet, only a minority of individuals develop problems with alcohol. Of those who develop problems with alcohol it is commonly believed that abstinence is the only option for successful functioning, however most people who develop problems with alcohol are not interested in abstaining from alcohol. The focus on abstinence as the only available option has created a treatment gap, whereby the majority of individuals with alcohol use disorder never receive treatment. \nThe current talk will provide data on the prevalence of alcohol use disorder, the possibility of drinking reduction as a treatment goal, the sustainability of reductions in drinking up to 3 years following treatment, and discuss alternative treatment options for drinking reduction. \n",

This talk is about using an algebraic incarnation of this invariant as a step towards classification of symplectic mapping tori. More precisely, we construct an open version of symplectic mapping torus of a symplectomorphism and distinguish it from the mapping torus of the identity as a (graded) Liouville manifold. As an application, we obtain pairs of diffeomorphic Liouville domains with the same symplectic cohomology groups, but that are different as open symplectic manifolds.\n",

Regression models with\nincomplete interactive or polynomial effects are a particularly important example because they are among the most common analyses in behavioral science research applications. In the context of single-level regression, fully Bayesian (model- based) imputation approaches have shown great promise with these popular analysis models. This talk will introduce attendees to model-based imputation for moderated regression analyses, including extensions of the procedure to multilevel models with random coefficients and non-linear terms.\n",

Is it more likely for a simple closed geodesic on X to be separating or non-separating? How much more likely? In her thesis, Mirzakhani gave very precise answers to these questions. One can ask analogous questions for square-tiled surfaces of genus 2 with one horizontal cylinder. Is it more likely for such a square-tiled surface to have separating or non-separating horizontal core curve? How much more likely? Recently, Delecroix, Goujard, Zograf, and Zorich gave very precise answers to these questions. Surprisingly enough, their answers were exactly the same as the ones in Mirzakhani\u2019s work. In this talk we explore the connections between these counting problems, showing they are related by more than just an accidental coincidence.\n",

The\r\nmost threatening crisis of our time (according to some) is climate change. Most\r\nenvironmentalists and scientists fight for change to improve the condition of our planet\r\n\u2013but why? Why should we care about the next generation, and if we do, is it only because\r\nwe are programmed to reproduce? If humanity decides to stop reproducing and live out\r\nthe rest of our lives without conserving or caring what we leave behind, will humans be\r\nhappier? Less stressed?

   "description": "A Woman\u2019s Voice in the House: Gender Composition and its Consequences in Committee Hearings\nDo increasing numbers of women in Congress lead to more representation of women\u2019s voices during the legislative process? Using committee hearing transcripts from 1995-2017, Pamela analyzes how increasing the proportions of women interacts with measures of perceived power to affect a member\u2019s participation in their committee by gender.\nIn line with extant findings emphasizing the moderating effects of institutions, she finds that increasing the proportions of women positively affects participation among majority-party and senior-ranking women. She then investigates the effect on measures of influence.\nBoth women and men are less likely to interrupt others when women\u2019s proportion on a committee increases. Further, women are more likely to stay on the same topic as other women, while men are likely to change topics introduced by women. The results show that increasing proportions of women work together with individuals\u2019 power status to increase women\u2019s voice and shift power dynamics within Congress.\nPamela\u00a0Ban\u00a0is assistant professor of political science at University of California San Diego. She\u00a0focuses on electoral politics, legislatures, political parties, and how these institutions influence the behavior of political actors.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She received a PhD in Political Economy and Government from Harvard University in 2018 and a BA in Applied Mathematics from Harvard University in 2012.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n*Political Institutions & Political Economy\n",

A sonically rich soundtrack adds to the eerie atmosphere as the call of birds and other nocturnal noises invisibly populate the austere landscape.\nEmerging from the ethos of Harvard\u2019s Sensory Ethnography Lab, J.P. Sniadecki\u2019s attentive documentary approach mixes perfectly with Joshua Bonnetta\u2019s meditations on the materiality of film. Together, they\u2019ve created an experience of the border region like nothing you\u2019ve seen, heard or felt before.\nProvided courtesy of Cinema Guild. Not rated. Running time: 94 minutes. In English and Spanish, with English subtitles.\nSELECT FESTIVALS & AWARDS\nOfficial Selection - Berlin International Film Festival, 2017\r\nOfficial Selection - San Francisco International Film Festival, 2017\r\nOfficial Selection - New York Film Festival, 2017\r\nOfficial Selection - BFI London Film Festival, 2017\r\nOfficial Selection - Vienna International Film Festival, 2017\r\nOfficial Selection - Chicago International Film Festival, 2017\r\nOfficial Selection - AFI FEST, 2017\r\nOfficial Selection - International Documentary Festival Amsterdam, 2017\r\nWinner - Caligari Film Award, Berlin International Film Festival\r\nWinner - Best Film, Dokufest Kosovo\r\nWinner - Best Film, Curitiba International Film Festival Winner- Universities Prize, lndielisboa\nAbout the Guest:\nJ.P. Sniadecki (b. 1979) works between China and the United States as an artist and anthropologist whose films explore collective experience, sensory ethnography, and the possibilities of cinema. His work is in the permanent collection of New York's Museum of Modern Art and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and has been exhibited at the Shanghai Biennale, the Whitney Biennale, the Shenzhen Biennale, the Centre George Pompidou and the Guggenheim, as well as at international film festivals, such as Berlin, BFI London, Locarno, New York, AFI, Viennale, Mar del Plata, and Beijing Independent Film Festival. Co-founder of the traveling screening series \"Cinema on the Edge,\" which showcases independent Chinese film, he has written articles for Cinema Scope and Visual Anthropology Review and the edited volume DV-Made China. A 2017 Guggenheim Fellow, he currently teaches in the Documentary Media MFA program at Northwestern University.\r\n\u00a0\r\nFor more information, please contact\u00a0\r\nMichael Renov / Email: renov@usc.edu\n",

   "description": "Danjoseph Quijada, USC\nAbstract: Key polynomials are a class of polynomials that contain and extend the Schur polynomials to an integer basis of the polynomial ring. They entered the literature under the guise of the Demazure character formula --- a generalization of the Weyl character formula --- and were later shown to give a nonnegative expansion of Schubert polynomials. Much like their Schur and Schubert cousins, key polynomials have enjoyed a wide array of enumerative constructions over the years since their discovery.\u00a0 However, while the Schur polynomials have the much celebrated Littlewood-Richardson rule, and meanwhile an analog of the Pierri rule is known for Schubert polynomials, the structure constants of key polynomials remain a mystery.\n",

First, under certain assumptions on the set to which this signal belongs (satisfied, for example, when this set is an intersection of elliptical cylinders, or the unit ball of the spectral norm in the space of matrices) and on the norm used to measure the estimation error, we construct a linear estimate of the recovered signal which is \"nearly optimal\u2019\u2019 among all estimates (linear or non-linear) in terms of expected loss in the worst case.\nThese results are an extension of traditional results (e.g., Pinsker 1980 and Donoho, Liu and MacGibbon, 1990) that impose much more restrictive assumptions on the signal set.\nWe will then present a simple generic non-linear estimator and show that, in some \"favorable cases,\" this proposed estimate is nearly optimal in the minimax sense.\n",

Davis Firearm Violence Research Center health.ucdavis.edu/vprp/, this two-hour seminar will feature talks and practical skills workshops about the impact of firearm violence and how individuals can work towards mitigating the risk of firearm-inflicted injury and death. The symposium will incorporate perspectives of medical providers, violence prevention researchers, community activists, community members, responsible gun owners, people affected by gun violence, law enforcement and more.\nFirearm violence threatens our health and safety, resulting in more than 30,000 deaths each year and approximately 75,000 nonfatal injuries in hospital emergency departments. Recently, tragic killings in New Zealand reminds us once again of the toll that firearm violence is having on our society. Close to home, USC student Victor McElhaney was killed two weeks ago just blocks from the USC University Park Campus. And while these events and numbers are alarming, they do not begin to capture the heartbreak endured by family and friends of the victims.\nDinner is included for registered guests and will be catered by Homeboy Industries, a non-profit that is dedicated to providing hope, training, and support to formerly incarcerated men and women.

To celebrate this milestone, they will offer a program showcasing the \u201cNew Movement\u201d\u2014movement that connects cultures through a diversity of movement practices and challenges the hierarchies of codified dance traditions. Newly commissioned works will reflect the extraordinary skills of dancers who move between contemporary movement, hip hop groove, and classical ballet. A pre-show discussion will explore the histories and cultures embodied within the different dance forms, while building bridges between American social dance such as hip hop and American ballet as developed by George Balanchine and others. A panel of choreographers will articulate how contemporary thought and practice have shaped a new generation of hybrid, collaborative dance artists.\n\nAdditional Links:\r\nUSC Kaufman School of Dance | Facebook, Twitter\n\r\nPresented by the USC Kaufman School of Dance.

The world is divided between those who can swim (Floaters) and those who can\u2019t (Rocks). Floaters control the world, and keep Rocks from swimming. At the Clandestine School of Rocks,\u00a0rebellious rocks learn to swim.\nPart interactive game, part immersive theatre, and part comedic storytelling from the mind of acclaimed performer Robert Farid Karimi, Swimming Pool Party explores racial disparities in swimming ability, and the intergenerational trauma at the root of them.\u00a0Swimming Pool Party features an exciting cast of\u00a0performing and visual artists, including award-winning performer Harry Waters Jr., water healer Rocio Navarro, sound design and percussion by DJ Gingee, visual design and music by DJ Arshia Haq, projections by Jojo Guarin, experience design magic by Rich Diltz, and MORE! The performance will educate, entertain, and\u00a0surprise you, with delicious prizes and a dance party.\nThe following day, Karimi, Sarah Hayes (Department of Physical\u00a0Education), Marientina Gotsis (Director of Creative Media & Behavioral Health Center), Rod Hernandez (Assistant Professor of English at Cal State University, Dominguez Hills), and members of the artistic ensemble will discuss the process of creating Swimming Pool Party, the issues at the heart of the show, and the power and pitfalls of transdisciplinary collaboration.\nKarimi developed Swimming Pool Party as an artist in residence at the USC Physical Education Department. For those who would enjoy a deeper experience of Swimming Pool Party, you can apply for an active role in the performance. Please apply at https://youcanfloat.party/.\n\nBios:\r\nRobert Farid Karimi has been entertaining and educating as a community-engagement specialist and comedic storyteller for 25 years. Working for clients like HBO, General Mills, and the Kresge Foundation, he brings food, comedy, and interactive storytelling to events for groups as small as 25 and as large as 5000+. He is also a producer/writer of his own comedy cooking show, The Peoples Cook, and a veteran of stages all over the world, touring the planet as producer/director, performance trickster, and speaker on issues such as mixed-race consciousness, food politics, and the power of the Fool to change the world. A Pushcart-nominated writer, his work has appeared in outlets including NPR, the L.A. Times, Asian American Literary Review, and The Wandering Song: Central American Writing in the United States. He is also a national poetry-slam champion who has featured at venues such as the Nuyorican Poets Caf\u00e9, the Chicago Theatre, Def Poetry Jam, the Smithsonian, and South by Southwest. Swimming Pool Party is part of a larger project by Karimi entitled Champion Swimmer. (Instagram, Twitter, USC MFA profile, Vimeo)\n\nRich Diltz is a creative artist based in Sacramento, CA. His specialties include airbrush, body painting, murals, and textile art. He also enjoys, and has experience in, puppetry, music performance, and interactive art. He has performed his work and organized teams at Disney World, Universal Studios, and the TV show Hollywood's Sexiest Jobs. His clients include many of the biggest names in Silicon Valley and the tech industry. He has been happily married for over 25 years and has two amazing kids. Current projects include indoor mermaids, spinning glow-in-the-dark mostly naked circus performers, forms of torture, dancing nocturnal animals, graffiti walls, and Bar Mitzvahs.\n\nGingee is a DJ/producer, percussionist, and vocalist known for her unique take on global bass. Her work reflects the sounds and cultures she has been exposed to growing up in Los Angeles, as well as the musical world of her Filipino ancestors and beyond. Her productions incorporate the sounds of percussion instruments such as the kulintang (gongs native to the Philippines), kettle drum, and cowbells with rap and poetry. Her 2015 EP, Tambol, made waves in the global music community and she recently released Solstice/Equinox, a four-part series of EPs that was released on every solstice and equinox throughout 2018.\n\nArshia Fatima Haq works across various mediums, including film, visual art, performance and sound, and is currently exploring themes of embodiment and mysticism, particularly within the Islamic Sufi context. Her body of work stems from the complexities of inhabiting multiple personas: woman, Muslim, immigrant, citizen, insider, outsider. She challenges and celebrates the socio-cultural and religious iconography she was raised with, and works with the kaleidoscopic varieties of aesthetic expression in the Muslim world that are marginalized both by conservative Islam and the Western imagination. Her work is conceptualized in feminist modes without reference to the Western feminist model, and narrative threads include migration, celebration, warfare, nostalgia, homeland, and borders, often within realms of Islamic influence, through lenses of traditional forms and kaleidoscopic reinventions of pop culture. Haq is the founder of Discostan, a collaborative decolonial project working with cultural production from the SWANA region.\n\nRocio Navarro is a sociologist, artist, and water healer. Over the last four years, she has helped over 300 people in the water, taking them through transformative experiences awakening to the whispers of the heart and soul. She has worked with couples having children; artists awakening their innermost creativity; individuals regaining intimacy and connection with themselves and loved ones; sufferers of PTSD, depression, and anxiety; and seekers of hidden potential and life dreams. Water healing is performed in a shallow body of temperature-controlled water and combines and integrates aspects of Watsu, Aguahara, Cranio-Sacral, Reiki, Sound, Cymatics, Epigenetics, and Energetics. Navarro provides individual and group sessions for people throughout Southern California, and occasionally does work with Tibetan bowls for sound and water healing sessions.\n\nSick Delicious (Alex \u201cJojo\u201d Guaring) creates visuals that are inspired by living in Southern California and draw from skate culture, street art, and underground music scenes such as hip hop and electronic. His art evolved from illustration to computer graphics, and today he focuses on motion design and live visuals for events. Mashing up hand-drawn and digital techniques to create a surreal psychedelic experience, his work has been showcased at events and venues such as Coachella and Grand Performances, and he has become a go-to designer within the Los Angeles art and music community. In collaboration with musical artist Gingee, he filters Filipino and American cultures through a modern audio-visual style that serves as a bridge between traditional and contemporary cultures, and inspires audiences to connect with their roots.\n\nHarry Waters Jr. created the role of Belize in the first production of Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes in 1991. He is most famous for portraying Marvin Berry in Back to the Future (1985), which earned him a gold record for his rendition of \u201cEarth Angel.\u201d Born in Tulsa, OK, and raised in Denver, CO, Waters attended Princeton University and received his MFA in Directing from University of Wisconsin-Madison. He worked as an actor in New York City on and off Broadway for many years, and has directed numerous productions around the Twin Cities and worked as a facilitator for the Many Voices\u00a0Roundtable at The Playwrights' Center. The professor and recent chair of the Theatre and Dance Department at Macalester College is currently working with his son, Jordon Waters, on WING IT, inspired by the tale of Icarus and Daedalus and continuing their performative conversations about fathers, sons, and sexual identity.\n\nAdditional Links:\nUSA Swimming Foundation: Constraints Impacting Minority Swimming Participation (Report)\n\r\nPresented by USC Visions and Voices: The Arts and Humanities Initiative.

How might early modern representations of cities\u2014both what they include and what they pass over in silence\u2014unsettle our present-day assumptions about the nature of urban space or the experience of urban life?

What categories and concepts are most useful for understanding the complex realities of the early modern Japanese city and its representation in diverse texts and documents?\nThis two-day workshop, which will combine presentations, discussions, and readings of original archival materials, will deepen and expand our understanding of early modern Japanese cities in various literary representations, theatrical works, historical documents, and government regulations.\u00a0At the same time, we hope to use this interdisciplinary forum to explore the state and future of early modern studies and elaborate on new methodologies.\nPresenters \nDavid Atherton (Harvard University) \nWilliam Fleming (UCSB) \nThomas Gaubatz (Northwestern University) \nRobert Goree (Wellesley University) \nYoshida Nobuyuki\uff08Professor Emeritus, Tokyo University\uff09\u3000*Workshop instructor\nYoshida Yuriko (Tokyo University of Foreign Studies)\nFabio Rambelli (UCSB) \nLuke Roberts (UCSB) \nSatoko Shimazaki (University of Southern California)\nAmy Stanley (Northwestern University) \nAnne Walthall (Professor Emerita, UC Irvine) \n\u00a0\nCo-Sponsored by the USC Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures\n\u00a0\n",

Reservations required. RSVP beginning Thursday, March 28, at 9 a.m.\n\nThursday, April 25\nSwimming Pool Party: Immersive-Theatre Game\nUSC Students, Staff, and Faculty: RSVP\nUSC Alumni: RSVP\nGeneral Public: RSVP\n\nFriday, April 26\r\nCreating Swimming Pool Party\nUSC Students, Staff, and Faculty: RSVP\nUSC Alumni: RSVP\nGeneral Public: RSVP\n\nDESCRIPTION:\r\nIt\u2019s 2080. The world is divided between those who can swim (Floaters) and those who can\u2019t (Rocks). Floaters control the world, and keep Rocks from swimming. At the Clandestine School of Rocks,\u00a0rebellious rocks learn to swim.\nPart interactive game, part immersive theatre, and part comedic storytelling from the mind of acclaimed performer Robert Farid Karimi, Swimming Pool Party explores racial disparities in swimming ability, and the intergenerational trauma at the root of them.\u00a0Swimming Pool Party features an exciting cast of\u00a0performing and visual artists, including award-winning performer Harry Waters Jr., water healer Rocio Navarro, sound design and percussion by DJ Gingee, visual design and music by DJ Arshia Haq, projections by Jojo Guarin, experience design magic by Rich Diltz, and MORE! The performance will educate, entertain, and\u00a0surprise you, with delicious prizes and a dance party.\nThe following day, Karimi, Sarah Hayes (Department of Physical\u00a0Education), Marientina Gotsis (Director of Creative Media & Behavioral Health Center), Rod Hernandez (Assistant Professor of English at Cal State University, Dominguez Hills), and members of the artistic ensemble will discuss the process of creating Swimming Pool Party, the issues at the heart of the show, and the power and pitfalls of transdisciplinary collaboration.\nKarimi developed Swimming Pool Party as an artist in residence at the USC Physical Education Department. For those who would enjoy a deeper experience of Swimming Pool Party, you can apply for an active role in the performance. Please apply at https://youcanfloat.party/.\n\nBios:\r\nRobert Farid Karimi has been entertaining and educating as a community-engagement specialist and comedic storyteller for 25 years. Working for clients like HBO, General Mills, and the Kresge Foundation, he brings food, comedy, and interactive storytelling to events for groups as small as 25 and as large as 5000+. He is also a producer/writer of his own comedy cooking show, The Peoples Cook, and a veteran of stages all over the world, touring the planet as producer/director, performance trickster, and speaker on issues such as mixed-race consciousness, food politics, and the power of the Fool to change the world. A Pushcart-nominated writer, his work has appeared in outlets including NPR, the L.A. Times, Asian American Literary Review, and The Wandering Song: Central American Writing in the United States. He is also a national poetry-slam champion who has featured at venues such as the Nuyorican Poets Caf\u00e9, the Chicago Theatre, Def Poetry Jam, the Smithsonian, and South by Southwest. Swimming Pool Party is part of a larger project by Karimi entitled Champion Swimmer. (Instagram, Twitter, USC MFA profile, Vimeo)\n\nRich Diltz is a creative artist based in Sacramento, CA. His specialties include airbrush, body painting, murals, and textile art. He also enjoys, and has experience in, puppetry, music performance, and interactive art. He has performed his work and organized teams at Disney World, Universal Studios, and the TV show Hollywood's Sexiest Jobs. His clients include many of the biggest names in Silicon Valley and the tech industry. He has been happily married for over 25 years and has two amazing kids. Current projects include indoor mermaids, spinning glow-in-the-dark mostly naked circus performers, forms of torture, dancing nocturnal animals, graffiti walls, and Bar Mitzvahs.\n\nGingee is a DJ/producer, percussionist, and vocalist known for her unique take on global bass. Her work reflects the sounds and cultures she has been exposed to growing up in Los Angeles, as well as the musical world of her Filipino ancestors and beyond. Her productions incorporate the sounds of percussion instruments such as the kulintang (gongs native to the Philippines), kettle drum, and cowbells with rap and poetry. Her 2015 EP, Tambol, made waves in the global music community and she recently released Solstice/Equinox, a four-part series of EPs that was released on every solstice and equinox throughout 2018.\n\nArshia Fatima Haq works across various mediums, including film, visual art, performance and sound, and is currently exploring themes of embodiment and mysticism, particularly within the Islamic Sufi context. Her body of work stems from the complexities of inhabiting multiple personas: woman, Muslim, immigrant, citizen, insider, outsider. She challenges and celebrates the socio-cultural and religious iconography she was raised with, and works with the kaleidoscopic varieties of aesthetic expression in the Muslim world that are marginalized both by conservative Islam and the Western imagination. Her work is conceptualized in feminist modes without reference to the Western feminist model, and narrative threads include migration, celebration, warfare, nostalgia, homeland, and borders, often within realms of Islamic influence, through lenses of traditional forms and kaleidoscopic reinventions of pop culture. Haq is the founder of Discostan, a collaborative decolonial project working with cultural production from the SWANA region.\n\nRocio Navarro is a sociologist, artist, and water healer. Over the last four years, she has helped over 300 people in the water, taking them through transformative experiences awakening to the whispers of the heart and soul. She has worked with couples having children; artists awakening their innermost creativity; individuals regaining intimacy and connection with themselves and loved ones; sufferers of PTSD, depression, and anxiety; and seekers of hidden potential and life dreams. Water healing is performed in a shallow body of temperature-controlled water and combines and integrates aspects of Watsu, Aguahara, Cranio-Sacral, Reiki, Sound, Cymatics, Epigenetics, and Energetics. Navarro provides individual and group sessions for people throughout Southern California, and occasionally does work with Tibetan bowls for sound and water healing sessions.\n\nSick Delicious (Alex \u201cJojo\u201d Guaring) creates visuals that are inspired by living in Southern California and draw from skate culture, street art, and underground music scenes such as hip hop and electronic. His art evolved from illustration to computer graphics, and today he focuses on motion design and live visuals for events. Mashing up hand-drawn and digital techniques to create a surreal psychedelic experience, his work has been showcased at events and venues such as Coachella and Grand Performances, and he has become a go-to designer within the Los Angeles art and music community. In collaboration with musical artist Gingee, he filters Filipino and American cultures through a modern audio-visual style that serves as a bridge between traditional and contemporary cultures, and inspires audiences to connect with their roots.\n\nHarry Waters Jr. created the role of Belize in the first production of Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes in 1991. He is most famous for portraying Marvin Berry in Back to the Future (1985), which earned him a gold record for his rendition of \u201cEarth Angel.\u201d Born in Tulsa, OK, and raised in Denver, CO, Waters attended Princeton University and received his MFA in Directing from University of Wisconsin-Madison. He worked as an actor in New York City on and off Broadway for many years, and has directed numerous productions around the Twin Cities and worked as a facilitator for the Many Voices\u00a0Roundtable at The Playwrights' Center. The professor and recent chair of the Theatre and Dance Department at Macalester College is currently working with his son, Jordon Waters, on WING IT, inspired by the tale of Icarus and Daedalus and continuing their performative conversations about fathers, sons, and sexual identity.\n\nAdditional Links:\nUSA Swimming Foundation: Constraints Impacting Minority Swimming Participation (Report)\n\r\nPresented by USC Visions and Voices: The Arts and Humanities Initiative.

To celebrate this milestone, they will offer a program showcasing the \u201cNew Movement\u201d\u2014movement that connects cultures through a diversity of movement practices and challenges the hierarchies of codified dance traditions. Newly commissioned works will reflect the extraordinary skills of dancers who move between contemporary movement, hip hop groove, and classical ballet. A pre-show discussion will explore the histories and cultures embodied within the different dance forms, while building bridges between American social dance such as hip hop and American ballet as developed by George Balanchine and others. A panel of choreographers will articulate how contemporary thought and practice have shaped a new generation of hybrid, collaborative dance artists.\n\nAdditional Links:\r\nUSC Kaufman School of Dance | Facebook, Twitter\n\r\nPresented by the USC Kaufman School of Dance.

   "description": "The inaugural meeting of the Early Modern Japanese Studies Workshop will bring together specialists from disciplines as diverse as literary studies, theater studies, history, and religious studies whose work deals with early modern Japan.\u00a0This year\u2019s theme is early modern cities. How were cities regulated and spatialized in the political imagination? How did literary works and theatrical productions or maps and gazetteers contribute to the formation of cities? How might early modern representations of cities\u2014both what they include and what they pass over in silence\u2014unsettle our present-day assumptions about the nature of urban space or the experience of urban life? How did goods and knowledge circulate through urban spaces? What new perspectives on urban areas do studies of social margins, gender, and liminal spaces open up? What categories and concepts are most useful for understanding the complex realities of the early modern Japanese city and its representation in diverse texts and documents?\nThis two-day workshop, which will combine presentations, discussions, and readings of original archival materials, will deepen and expand our understanding of early modern Japanese cities in various literary representations, theatrical works, historical documents, and government regulations.\u00a0At the same time, we hope to use this interdisciplinary forum to explore the state and future of early modern studies and elaborate on new methodologies.\nPresenters \nDavid Atherton (Harvard University) \nWilliam Fleming (UCSB) \nThomas Gaubatz (Northwestern University) \nRobert Goree (Wellesley University) \nYoshida Nobuyuki\uff08Professor Emeritus, Tokyo University\uff09\u3000*Workshop instructor\nYoshida Yuriko (Tokyo University of Foreign Studies)\nFabio Rambelli (UCSB) \nLuke Roberts (UCSB) \nSatoko Shimazaki (University of Southern California)\nAmy Stanley (Northwestern University) \nAnne Walthall (Professor Emerita, UC Irvine) \n\u00a0\nCo-Sponsored by the USC Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures\n\u00a0\n",

There are at least 50 different types of soft tissue sarcoma which develop in the muscles, fat cells, blood vessels, tendons, nerves, the linking of joints or lymph vessels. This type of cancer represents approximately 25% of all adolescent and young adult cancers .Osteosarcoma and Ewing\u2019s Sarcoma are two of the most common bone sarcomas diagnosed in younger patients; osteosarcoma is the most common bone cancer. \nThe Symposium will offer new and practical information covering the spectrum of important issues in AYA sarcoma, including our current understanding of tumor biology; multi-modal therapy including surgery, radiation and chemotherapy; and survivorship and supportive care to improve quality of life. The Symposium will include a simulated \u201cTumor Board\u201d discussion of an actual patient that will demonstrate the importance of coordinated, team-based care. \nFinally, presentations by AYA sarcoma survivors will offer practical information and inspiration to all. Presenters will include experienced physicians and other clinical providers, academic researchers, and patient advocates. \nAudience participation is encouraged through interactive Q&A periods throughout the day.\u00a0 \n",

There is an incredible number of different styles of sundials. In mathematics, the geometry of shadows is called\u00a0 \"projective geometry\".\u00a0 The talk will feature some very old sundials, as well as more modern ones that use fractal geometry.\n__________________________________________\n\u00c9tienne Ghys is a French mathematician. His scientific contributions deal with the geometry and topology of dynamical systems. For instance, one of his results allows a better understanding of the famous Lorenz butterfly, a paradigmatic object in chaos theory. Working as a senior researcher in CNRS (French National Center for Scientific Research), he has been instrumental in the creation and development of the mathematics department in the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, in Lyon. More recently he has been involved in several actions towards the public dissemination of mathematics, for instance through the creation of an online journal aimed at a general public, or the production of mathematical movies. He received the Clay award for the dissemination of mathematics. His most recent book (A singular mathematical promenade) proposes a visual approach to the theory of singularities of planar curves. He has been elected Permanent Secretary of the French Academy of Sciences in January 2019.\nAn event co-organized by the USC Department of Mathematics and the Consulate General of France in Los Angeles, and graciously hosted by Professor Kelvin Davies, USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology/Ethel Percy Andrus Gerontology Center.\n\u00a0\n",

   "description": "Title: A method to develop a comic based on your research: From scientists, for scientists, and beyond.\nSpeakers:\u00a0\n\u2022 Jan Friesen, PhD, is an eco-hydrologist in the Department of Catchment Hydrology at the Helmholtz Centre of Environmental Research - UFZ in Leipzig, Germany.\r\n\u2022 Skander Elleuche, PhD, is a trained biologist and biotechnologist at Miltenyi Biotec GmbH in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany. \u00a0In 2018, he published his first popular science book that includes cartoon illustrations on \u201cMicrobes From Extreme Environments\u201d (in German).\nOverview: Scientists are increasingly challenged to communicate their work to broader, more varied audiences. Traditionally, scientists are trained to tell fact-based scientific stories. Although a carefully constructed scientific story may be crystal clear to other scientists in the same discipline, they are often inaccessible to broader audiences.\u00a0\nThis webinar will highlight a simple, flexible framework for translating a complex scientific publication into a broadly accessible comic format. Comics, by transporting information in a largely visual manner, can be easily understood by a wide variety of audiences. However, turning scientific content into a comic requires reducing and generalizing the content of scientific publications. The webinar will provide an overview of a framework that provides guidelines on how to develop a conceptual foundation, a scientifically-relevant setting and characters, as well as a detailed storyboard. \u00a0\nRegistration: https://bit.ly/2HtP0bt\nFor more information, please email Katja Reuter (katja.reuter@med.usc.edu) or NamQuyen Le (namquyen.le@med.usc.edu)\n",

From the Spanish missionary expeditions in the early 1500s to the Golden Age of Hollywood to the strange new world of social media, the collection of letters in\u00a0Dear Los Angeles\u00a0is a slice of life in L.A. through the years. The pieces are arranged by date\u2014January 1st to December 31st\u2014featuring selections from different decades and centuries. What emerges is a vivid tapestry of insights, personal discoveries, and wry observations that together distill the essence of the city.\nDavid Kipen\u00a0is the former literature director of the National Endowment for the Arts, and currently serves as book critic for\u00a0Los Angeles\u00a0Magazine and critic-at-large for\u00a0The Los Angeles Times\u00a0and teaches in the writing program at UCLA. Born and raised in Los Angeles, Kipen opened the Boyle Heights bookstore and lending library Libros Schmibros in 2010. The former book editor/critic of the San Francisco Chronicle and contributor to multiple volumes of California cultural history, Kipen holds a degree in literature from Yale University. \u00a0\nLynell George\u00a0is a Los Angeles-based journalist and essayist. She is the author of\u00a0No Crystal Stair African Americans in the City of Angelsand \u00a0After/Image: Los Angeles Outside the Frame, a collection of her essays and photographs. She won a 2018 GRAMMY for liner notes for \u201cOtis Redding Live at the Whisky A Go Go.\u201d\n",

Using mouse genetics and human pluripotent stem cells as models, we have systematically investigated the phenotypes and mechanisms underlying impaired neurogenesis in neurodevelopmental disorders. One of the proteins that we have been focusing on is Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), a brain-enriched RNA-binding protein. Functional loss of FMRP leads to Fragile X syndrome, the most common monogenetic form of inherited intellectual disability and the largest single genetic contributor to autism. We have discovered that FMRP regulates postnatal and adult neurogenesis and uncovered underlying mechanisms such as altered epigenetic state and mitochondrial dysfunction. Our work has unveiled novel therapeutic targets that may be used for treatment. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n",

   "description": "The Omohundro Institute\u00a0and the University of Southern California-Huntington Library Early Modern Studies Institute are pleased to announce the fourteenth in a series of William and Mary Quarterly-EMSI workshops designed to identify and encourage new trends in understanding the history and culture of early North America and its wider world.\nParticipants will attend a three-day meeting at the Huntington Library (May 9\u201311, 2019) to discuss a precirculated chapter-length portion of their current work in progress along with the work of other participants. Subsequently, the convener may write an essay elaborating on the issues raised at the workshop for publication in the William and Mary Quarterly. The convener of this year\u2019s workshop is Robin Beck of the University of Michigan\u2019s Department of Anthropology and Museum of Anthropological Archaeology.\nEarly America refers to a time, a place, and a vast field of interaction. Its starting point has traditionally been defined by Columbus\u2019s 1492 arrival in the Western Hemisphere, though different dates pertain in different places, depending on when Europeans first intruded into local sequences: 1519, 1534, 1539, 1598, 1607, 1620, and so on. Regardless of the particular date, we all too often base our ideas of what is and is not early America on a seemingly Eurocentric foundation. Robust literatures in a variety of disciplines have challenged found-ing narratives of this sort, but those same disciplines conceive of and interrogate the tempo-ral limits of early America differently. Nowhere, perhaps, is the disconnect more pervasive than in the ways that archaeologists and historians approach these limits. Archaeology\u2014traditionally the realm of so-called prehistorians\u2014works toward foundational dates, while history\u2014with its emphasis on text\u2014works away from them. The methods and tools that enable scholarship in either direction are often difficult to transfer across the divide.\nThis workshop will invite archaeologists and historians of early America for a conversation about bridging such long-standing divides between our respective disciplines. How might archaeologists draw from the tools of history (narrative, for example) to better people the pasts we reconstruct through analyses of material culture? What are some of the practical challenges for archaeologists seeking to shift from a dependence on general typology to more historically grounded frameworks? How might historians better incorporate archaeological approaches into their own analyses and interpretations? How can they better use archaeological data, and how could archaeologists more effectively present such data to interested historians? How do the perspectives of Native historians and archaeologists contribute to these goals? We aim for richer, more inclusive narratives, ones that are not constrained by artificially truncated chronologies of early America.\nQuestions may be directed to Joshua Piker, Editor, William and Mary Quarterly, at\u00a0japiker@wm.edu.\nThe\u00a0WMQ-EMSI Workshops are sponsored by the University of Southern California-Huntington Early Modern Studies Institute (with financial support from the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, the Mellon Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Humanities) and the Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture and are hosted by the Huntington Library and the University of Southern California.\n",

   "description": "The Omohundro Institute\u00a0and the University of Southern California-Huntington Library Early Modern Studies Institute are pleased to announce the fourteenth in a series of William and Mary Quarterly-EMSI workshops designed to identify and encourage new trends in understanding the history and culture of early North America and its wider world.\nParticipants will attend a three-day meeting at the Huntington Library (May 9\u201311, 2019) to discuss a precirculated chapter-length portion of their current work in progress along with the work of other participants. Subsequently, the convener may write an essay elaborating on the issues raised at the workshop for publication in the William and Mary Quarterly. The convener of this year\u2019s workshop is Robin Beck of the University of Michigan\u2019s Department of Anthropology and Museum of Anthropological Archaeology.\nEarly America refers to a time, a place, and a vast field of interaction. Its starting point has traditionally been defined by Columbus\u2019s 1492 arrival in the Western Hemisphere, though different dates pertain in different places, depending on when Europeans first intruded into local sequences: 1519, 1534, 1539, 1598, 1607, 1620, and so on. Regardless of the particular date, we all too often base our ideas of what is and is not early America on a seemingly Eurocentric foundation. Robust literatures in a variety of disciplines have challenged found-ing narratives of this sort, but those same disciplines conceive of and interrogate the tempo-ral limits of early America differently. Nowhere, perhaps, is the disconnect more pervasive than in the ways that archaeologists and historians approach these limits. Archaeology\u2014traditionally the realm of so-called prehistorians\u2014works toward foundational dates, while history\u2014with its emphasis on text\u2014works away from them. The methods and tools that enable scholarship in either direction are often difficult to transfer across the divide.\nThis workshop will invite archaeologists and historians of early America for a conversation about bridging such long-standing divides between our respective disciplines. How might archaeologists draw from the tools of history (narrative, for example) to better people the pasts we reconstruct through analyses of material culture? What are some of the practical challenges for archaeologists seeking to shift from a dependence on general typology to more historically grounded frameworks? How might historians better incorporate archaeological approaches into their own analyses and interpretations? How can they better use archaeological data, and how could archaeologists more effectively present such data to interested historians? How do the perspectives of Native historians and archaeologists contribute to these goals? We aim for richer, more inclusive narratives, ones that are not constrained by artificially truncated chronologies of early America.\nQuestions may be directed to Joshua Piker, Editor, William and Mary Quarterly, at\u00a0japiker@wm.edu.\nThe\u00a0WMQ-EMSI Workshops are sponsored by the University of Southern California-Huntington Early Modern Studies Institute (with financial support from the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, the Mellon Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Humanities) and the Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture and are hosted by the Huntington Library and the University of Southern California.\n",

   "description": "Continuing the tradition of dedication to providing a comprehensive and current update in the management of thyroid disease, USC presents The USC Peter A. Singer Thyroid\u00a0Symposium 2019. Much like the very first symposium organized by Dr. Singer, we seek to forster enthusiasm about thyroid care in an increasingly complex and evolving field.\u00a0\nFor this program, forward-looking perspectives are presented illustrating the current state of thyroid medicine and where we are likely to go from here. The clinical landscape of thyroid care is characterized by growing management options and individualized care. Potential options now abound for common conditions such as thyroid nodules, thyroid cancer, hypothyroidism, and Graves\u2019 disease.\nFor 2019, we tackle areas of current debate and newer data influencing patient management, including thyroid care in the internet age,TSH receptor antibody testing, comprehensive evaluation of thyroid nodules, molecular testing, and surgery for thyroid cancer. Presentations combining evidence-based medicine and clinical experience, challenging cases, and panel discussions with audience questions, will help inform practice decisions in an era of complex clinical problems.\nWe hope you enjoy the meeting!\n",

   "description": "\u201cStructure and Function of Spliceosome\u201d\nAbstract: Pre-mRNA splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a huge protein-RNA complex composed of the U1, U2, U4, U5, U6 snRNPs and many non-snRNP related proteins. U1 snRNP plays a critical role in 5\u02b9 splice site recognition and is a frequent target of alternative splicing factors. These factors transiently associate with human U1 snRNP and are not amenable for structural studies, while their yeast homologs are stable components of U1 snRNP. \nWe have recently determined the structure of yeast U1 snRNP using cryoEM. The structure offers a framework to integrate a wealth of existing genetic and biochemical data regarding the structure and function of yeast U1 snRNP and the mechanism of 5\u2019 ss recognition. In addition, the yeast U1 snRNP structure and biochemical analyses based on the structure provided insight into the structure and function of these auxiliary human U1 snRNP proteins in alternative splicing in higher eukaryotes. \nFollowing the recognition of the 5\u2019 ss by U1 snRNP, at least 10 other spliceosomal complexes form sequentially in a splicing cycle. We have recently determined the cryoEM structure of the yeast P complex at 3.3\u00c5 resolution, providing insights into the 3\u2019 ss recognition, exon ligation, and the action of RNA helicase Prp22.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n",

Providing security for practically-deployed systems requires a new approach to cryptography, one that begins with the context in which cryptographic protocols will be used and reasons backwards in order to obtain the necessary security properties. This talk will cover two examples of this approach. First, I will take a detailed look at confidentiality for payments and how to solve the privacy failures of blockchain protocols such as Bitcoin. I will detail the design, implementation, and commercial deployment of Zcash, the first system to offer confidentiality while preserving public verifiability for cryptocurrencies. Next, I will explore cryptography in the context of securing data against breaches, considering the reality that attackers will gain access to cryptographic key material --- thus rendering traditional encryption ineffective. I will show how to use new applications of puncturable encryption to address these vulnerabilities for messaging and device encryption.\n\nThis lecture satisfies requirements for CSCI 591: Research Colloquium\n\n\n\nBiography: Ian Miers is a postdoctoral researcher at Cornell Tech working on computer security and applied cryptography. His research focuses on making systems secure by exploring cryptography in the context of real world problems. This includes Zerocoin and Zerocash, the first systems to provide strongly confidential payments on top of public blockchains and work improving secure messaging including attacks on Apple's iMessage protocol and new techniques for puncturable forward secure encryption. His work has been featured in The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Economist, and denounced in at least two editorials. He is one of the founders of Zcash, a privacy preserving cryptocurrency based on Zerocash.\n\nHost: Muhammad Naveed",

   "description": "Speaker: Dinesh Jayaraman, Postdoctoral Scholar/University of California, Berkeley\n\nTalk Title: Towards Embodied Visual Intelligence\n\nAbstract: What would it mean for a machine to see the world? Computer vision has recently made great progress on problems such as finding categories of objects and scenes, and poses of people in images. However, studying such tasks in isolated disembodied contexts, divorced from the physical source of their images, is insufficient to build intelligent visual agents. My research focuses on remarrying vision to action, by asking: how might vision benefit from the ability to act in the world, and vice versa? Could embodied visual agents teach themselves through interaction and experimentation? Are there actions they might perform to improve their visual perception? How might they construct visual plans to achieve long-term action goals? In my talk, I will set up the context for these questions, and cover some strands of my work addressing them, proposing approaches for self-supervised learning through proprioception, visual prediction for decomposing complex control tasks, and active perception. Finally, I will discuss my long-term vision and directions that I hope to work on in the next several years.\n\nBiography: Dinesh Jayaraman is a postdoctoral scholar at UC Berkeley. He received his PhD from UT Austin (2017) and B. Tech from IIT Madras (2011). His research interests are broadly in computer vision, robotics, and machine learning. In the last few years, he has worked on visual prediction, active perception, self-supervised visual learning, visuo-tactile robotic manipulation, semantic visual attributes, and zero-shot categorization. He has received an ACCV Best Application Paper Award (2016), a Samsung PhD Fellowship (2016), a UT Austin Graduate Dean's Fellowship (2016), and a Microelectronics and Computer Development Fellowship Award (2011). He has published in and reviewed for conferences and journals in computer vision, machine learning, and robotics, received a CVPR Outstanding Reviewer Award (2016), is as an Area Chair for NeurIPS (2018 & 2019).\n\nHost: Professor Rahul Jain, rahul.jain@usc.edu",

As a result, there is an increasing need for technology that can provide basic programming support to such non-expert computer end-users. Program synthesis, as a technique for automatically generating programs from high-level specifications, has been used to automate real-world programming tasks in a number of application domains (such as spreadsheet programming and data science) that non-expert users struggle with. However, developing specialized synthesizers for these domains is notoriously hard. \n\nIn this talk, I will describe a unified program synthesis framework that can be applied broadly to automating tasks across different application domains. This framework is also efficient and achieves orders of magnitude improvement in terms of synthesis speed compared to existing techniques. In particular, I have used this framework to build synthesizers for three different application domains and achieved up to 450x speed-up compared to state-of-the-art synthesis techniques. \n\nThis lecture satisfies requirements for CSCI 591: Research Colloquium. \n\nBiography: Xinyu Wang is a PhD candidate at UT Austin advised by Isil Dillig. He works at the intersection of programming languages, software engineering and formal methods. He is interested in developing foundational program synthesis techniques that are applicable to automating real-world programming tasks. \n\nHost: Chao Wang",

Gordon, Research Associate Professor of Computer Science and Director of Interactive Narrative Research at USC ICT\n\nTalk Title: Playing Story Creation Games With Logical Abduction\n\nSeries: AAAI@USC Lecture Series\n\nAbstract: Story Creation Games, such as Rory's Story Cubes and the Tell Tale card game, require players to invent creative and coherent narratives from a set of unconnected elements assembled by random chance, e.g., the throw of a die or the draw of a card. Often producing comical and entertaining storylines, these games also demonstrate the remarkable human capacity for sense-making, where one's knowledge and experience is used to explain the co-occurrence of novel combinations of observations. In this talk, I describe our recent efforts to build a computer program that could successfully play story creation games. We view this task as an interpretation problem, where the aim is to identify a coherent narrative where each narrative element plays a structural role. Our approach is to solve this interpretation problem using logical abduction, searching for sets of narrative assumptions that logically entail each of the given narrative elements. The search proceeds by backchaining from narrative elements through a knowledge base of narrative and causal axioms expressed as first-order definite clauses, unifying assumptions wherever possible. After finding connected solutions that entail the given set of narrative elements, the structure of the proof graphs are then used to generate the natural language text representation of the interpretation. In this talk, I demonstrate this approach in generating eight creative narratives given the same set of three Tell Tale cards, depicting a train, a baseball player, and the symbol of a heart. These examples demonstrate that logical abduction is well-suited to this task, but also underscore the enormous knowledge bottleneck that must be overcome to play this game with arbitrary cards. I contrast our approach with recent efforts to generate narrative text using deep neural networks trained with narrative corpora, and discuss whether these approaches fundamentally change the nature of this knowledge bottleneck. \n\nRSVP: https://forms.gle/FXMS1nJ8W3oqveYv8 \n\n\nBiography: Andrew S. Gordon is Research Associate Professor of Computer Science and Director of Interactive Narrative Research at the Institute for Creative Technologies at the University of Southern California. His research advances technologies for automatically analyzing and generating narrative interpretations of experiences. A central aim of his research is the large-scale formalization of commonsense knowledge, and reasoning with these formalizations using logical abduction. He is the author of the 2004 book \"Strategy Representation: An Analysis of Planning Knowledge,\" and the 2017 book \"A Formal Theory of Commonsense Psychology: How People Think People Think\" (with Jerry R. Hobbs). He received his Ph.D. in 1999 from Northwestern University.\n\nHost: AAAI@USC",

For example, in the environmental sustainability domain, the problem of protecting endangered wildlife from attacks (i.e., poachers' strikes) can be abstracted as a game between defender(s) and attacker(s). Applying previous research on security games to sustainability domains (denoted as Green Security Games) introduce several novel challenges that I address in my thesis to create computationally feasible and accurate algorithms in order to model complex adversarial behavior based on the real-world data and to generate optimal defender strategy. My thesis provides four main contributions to the emerging body of research in using machine learning and game theory framework for the fundamental challenges existing in the environmental sustainability domain, namely (i) novel spatio-temporal and uncertainty-aware machine learning models for complex adversarial behavior based on the imperfect real-world data, (ii) the first large-scale field test evaluation of the machine learning models in the adversarial settings concerning the environmental sustainability, (iii) a novel multi-expert online learning model for constrained patrol planning, and (iv) the first game theoretical model to generate optimal defender strategy against collusive adversaries. In regard to the first contribution, I developed bounded rationality models for adversaries based on the real-world data that account for the naturally occurring uncertainty in past attack evidence collected by defenders. To that end, I proposed two novel predictive behavioral models, which I improved progressively. The second major contribution of my thesis is a large-scale field test evaluation of the proposed adversarial behavior model beyond the laboratory. Particularly, my thesis is motivated by the challenges in wildlife poaching, where I directed the defenders (i.e., rangers) to the hotspots of adversaries that they would have missed. During these experiments across multiple vast national parks, several snares and snared animals were detected, and poachers were arrested, potentially more wildlife saved. The algorithm I proposed, that combines machine learning and game-theoretic patrol planning is planned to be deployed at 600 national parks around the world in the near future to combat poaching. The third contribution in my thesis introduces a novel multi-expert online learning model for constrained and randomized patrol planning, which benefits from several expert planners where insufficient or imperfect historical records of past attacks are available to learn adversarial behavior. The final contribution of my thesis is developing an optimal solution against collusive adversaries in security games assuming both rational and boundedly rational adversaries. I conducted human subject experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk involving 700 human subjects using a web-based game that simulates collusive security games.",

   "description": "Speaker: Mukund Raghothaman, University of Pennsylvania\n\nTalk Title: Precise Program Reasoning using Probabilistic Methods\n\nSeries: CS Colloquium\n\nAbstract: The enormous rise in the scale, scope, and complexity of software projects has created a thriving marketplace for program analysis and verification tools. Despite routine adoption by industry, developing such tools remains challenging, and their designers must carefully balance tradeoffs between false alarms, missed bugs, and scalability to large codebases. Furthermore, when tools fail to verify some program property, they only provide coarse estimates of alarm relevance, potential severity, and of the likelihood of being a real bug, thereby limiting their usefulness in software projects with large teams.\n\nI will present a framework that extends contemporary program reasoning systems with rich probabilistic models. These models emerge naturally from the program structure, and probabilistic inference refines the deductive process of the underlying system. In experiments with large programs, such probabilistic graphical representations of program structure enable an order-of-magnitude reduction in false alarm rates and invocations of expensive reasoning engines such as SMT solvers.\n\nTo the analysis user, these techniques offer a lens by which to focus their attention on the most important alarms and a uniform method for the tool to interactively generalize from human feedback. To the analysis designer, they offer novel opportunities to leverage data-driven approaches in analysis design. And to researchers, they offer new challenges while performing inference in models of unprecedented size. I will conclude by describing how these ideas promise to underpin the next generation of intelligent programming systems, with applications in diverse areas such as program synthesis, differentiable programming, and fault localization in complex systems.\n\nThis lecture satisfies requirements for CSCI 591: Research Colloquium. \n\nBiography: Mukund Raghothaman is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania. His research spans the areas of programming languages, software verification, and program synthesis, with the ultimate goal to help programmers create better software with less effort. He previously obtained a Ph.D. in 2017, also from the University of Pennsylvania, where he developed programming abstractions for data stream processing systems.\n\nHost: Jyotirmoy Deshmukh",

   "description": "Speaker: Bala Balachandran, University of Maryland\n\nTalk Title: Nonlinear Dynamics with Noise\n\nAbstract: Nonlinearity influenced dynamics occurs in a variety of mechanical and structural systems. For operations of many of these systems, noise is often viewed as being undesirable. However, the interplay between noise and nonlinearity in a system can result in significant response changes that can be beneficial to a systems performance. In this spirit, the work carried out to further our understanding on the constructive use of noise in a nonlinear system to realize noise-enhanced responses, noise-enabled stabilization, and noise-assisted response steering will be discussed. Efforts undertaken with partial control will be discussed. Representative physical systems that will be considered include coupled oscillator arrays at the micro-scale and macro-scale, flexible rotor systems, and pendulum systems. The findings of these studies are expected to be relevant to a variety of different nonlinear, mechanical and structural systems. Some thoughts on future directions in the realm of applied nonlinear dynamics will be presented to close the talk.\n\nBala Balachandran received his B.

However, many prior works on Internet services only focus on the security of an individual network layer in isolation, whereas the adversaries do quite the opposite -\u201c they look for opportunities to exploit the interactions across heterogeneous components and layers to compromise the system security. This gap leaves the privacy and security of billions of users as well as our critical infrastructure at risk.\nI aim to bridge this gap to build privacy-preserving and secure Internet services. In this talk, I will focus on two Internet services, the Tor network and the Public Key Infrastructure. I have uncovered new vulnerabilities in these services by taking a cross-layer approach to exploit the interdependencies across different network layers. I have demonstrated attacks in the wild (ethically) to evaluate the real effects of vulnerabilities. Consequently, I have built practical defenses that have received real-world deployment by the Tor Project which serves millions of users, and Let's Encrypt which is the world's largest Certificate Authority that has issued hundreds of millions of digital certificates.\n\nThis lecture satisfies requirements for CSCI 591: Research Colloquium. \n\nBiography: Yixin Sun is a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Princeton University.

   "description": "Speaker: Nandita Vijaykumar, PhD Candidate/Carnegie Mellon University\n\nTalk Title: Rethinking the Hardware-Software Contract: Enabling Practical and General Cross-Layer Optimizations\n\nAbstract: Layered abstractions in the computing stack are critical to building complex systems, but the existing *interfaces* between layers restrict what can be done at each level. Enhancing cross-layer interfaces--specifically, the hardware-software interface--is crucial towards addressing two important and hard-to-solve challenges in computer systems today: First, significant effort and expertise are required to write high-performance code that harnesses the full potential of today's diverse and sophisticated hardware. Second, as a hardware or system designer, architecting faster and more efficient systems is challenging as the vast majority of the program's semantic content and programmer intent gets lost in translation with today's hardware-software interface. Moving towards the future, these challenges in programmability and efficiency will be even more intractable as we architect increasingly heterogeneous and sophisticated systems. \n\nIn this talk, I will highlight my work [ISCA'15, MICRO'16, ISCA'18, ISCA'18] on how to design rich cross-layer abstractions that provide layered interfaces to directly communicate higher-level program semantics and intent from the application to the lower levels of the stack. In doing so, we can effectively bridge the so-called \"semantic gap\" between applications and computer systems, and enable a wide range of cross-layer optimizations in future systems with a single unifying interface. I will discuss how cross-layer approaches with these abstractions can significantly enhance (1) performance and efficiency by enabling the system to adapt to application characteristics and (2) programmability and portability by enabling application software to easily leverage diverse underlying hardware resources without specific knowledge of system details. For example, daunting aspects of programming GPUs can be made much simpler with a rich cross-layer programming abstraction. I will describe how such abstractions can be designed to be highly practical and low-overhead, requiring only small additions to existing abstractions.\n\nBiography: Nandita Vijaykumar is a Ph.D. candidate at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Prof. Onur Mutlu and Prof. Phillip Gibbons. She is also currently a visiting student at ETH Zurich. Her research focuses on the interaction between programming models, system software, and hardware architecture in an increasingly diverse compute landscape, with a focus on memory systems and modern accelerators like GPUs. She is excited about enabling cross-layer full-stack solutions to make future systems highly efficient and easy-to-program. She is the recipient of the Benjamin Garver Lamme/Westinghouse Fellowship at CMU. During her Ph.D., she has been fortunate to intern at Microsoft Research, Nvidia Research, and Intel Labs.\n\nHost: Professor Xuehai Qian, xuehai.qian@usc.edu",

   "description": "Speaker: Nima Fazeli, MIT\n\nTalk Title: Towards Robotic Manipulation, Understanding the World Through Contact\n\nAbstract: Why is robotic manipulation so hard? As humans, we are unrivaled in our ability to dexterously manipulate objects and exhibit complex skills seemingly effortlessly. Recent research in cognitive science suggests that this ability is driven by our internal representations of the physical world, built over a life-time of experience. Our predictive ability is complemented by our senses of sight and touch, intuitive state-estimation, and tactile dexterity. Given the complexity of human reasoning, skill, and hardware, it is not surprising that we have yet to replicate our abilities in robots. In order to bridge this gap, we must develop robotic systems that build their understanding and interpretation of the physical world through contact. Using experiments as tools, these Galilean Robots will distill their experiences into models of the physical world.\n\nIn this talk, I will present some of my work spanning the spectrum of analytical to fully data driven methodologies for model building and inference through contact. I believe that Galilean Robots need to master tools from this spectrum for intelligent and dexterous manipulation. First, I will discuss a methodology for the inference of contact forces and system parameters of rigid bodies systems making and breaking contact. I will then touch on data augmented contact models for controls as a medium between analytical and data driven techniques. I will show how a robot can learn the physics of playing Jenga using a hierarchical learning methodology purely from data. I will conclude the talk by providing perspectives on building Galilean Robotic systems that embody intelligent manipulation.\n\nNima Fazeli is a PhD student with the Mechanical Engineering Department at MIT, working with Prof. Alberto Rodriguez. His research focuses on enabling intelligent and dexterous robotic manipulation by developing novel tools combining analytical methods, machine learning, and cognition/AI. During his PhD, Nima has developed inference algorithms for robotic systems undergoing frictional contact, performed empirical evaluations of contact models, demonstrated data-augmented contact models for manipulation, and developed a robotic system capable of learning the physics of playing Jenga using a hierarchical learning methodology. Nima received his masters from the University of Maryland at College Park where he spent most of his time developing analytical and data-driven models of the human (and, on occasion, swine) arterial tree together with novel inference algorithms to diagnoses cardiovascular diseases. His research has been supported by the Rohsenow Fellowship and featured in outlets such as CBS, CNN, and the BBC. He looks forward to robots playing and learning alongside his grandchildren.\n\nThursday, April 4, 2019\n11:00 AM\nThe Laufer Library (RRB 208)\nRefreshments will be served at 10:45 AM.\n\nHost: AME Department",

In this talk, I will discuss two types of emerging demands and present infrastructure systems we have developed to meet those demands. The first part of the talk will focus on the demanding performance requirements brought by emerging highly interactive applications such as remote robotic manipulation, remote surgery, and collaborative virtual reality. These applications require communication that is both timely and highly reliable, but the Internet natively supports only communication that is either completely reliable with no timeliness guarantees (e.g. TCP) or timely with only best-effort reliability (e.g. UDP). We present an overlay transport service that can provide highly reliable communication while meeting the stringent timeliness requirements of these applications. The second part of the talk will address the demanding security and resilience needs of critical infrastructure services, in particular SCADA systems for the power grid, that are increasingly becoming exposed to malicious attacks. I will present our work building Spire, the first intrusion-tolerant SCADA system for the power grid that is resilient to both system-level compromises and sophisticated network-level attacks.\n\nThis lecture satisfies requirements for CSCI 591: Research Colloquium. \n\nBiography: Amy Babay recently completed her PhD in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University, where she was a member of the Distributed Systems and Networks Lab.

   "description": "Speaker: Mahsa Shoaran, Cornell University\n\nTalk Title: Ultra-Low-Power Neural Interfaces: from Monitoring to  Diagnosis and Therapy\n\nAbstract: Implantable and wearable medical devices are increasingly being developed as alternative therapies for intractable diseases. In particular, undertreated neurological disorders such as epilepsy, migraine, and Alzheimer's disease are of major public health concern around the world, driving the need to explore such new approaches. Despite significant advances in neural interface systems, the small number of recording channels in existing technology remains a barrier to their therapeutic potential. This is mainly due to the fact that simultaneous recording from a large number of electrodes imposes stringent energy and area constraints on the integrated circuits that interface with these electrodes. In this talk, I will first discuss an efficient compressive sensing framework for multichannel cortical implants. Next, I will present the design of our sub-microwatt per channel closed-loop seizure control device and both its in-vivo and offline performance. I will then discuss our latest work on the integration of machine learning algorithms for on-chip classification of neural data. Finally, I will give examples of how these results may be used towards designing new devices, to enhance the lives of millions of people suffering from disabling neurological conditions in future.\n\nBiography: Mahsa Shoaran is currently an Assistant Professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University. Prior to joining Cornell, she was a postdoctoral fellow in Electrical Engineering and Medical Engineering at the California Institute of Technology. She received her PhD from EPFL in 2015 and her B.Sc. and M.Sc. from Sharif University of Technology. Her research interests broadly include circuit, system, and algorithm design for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

Coronel, Sandia National Laboratories\n\nTalk Title: Ignition Dynamics of Reactive Gaseous Mixtures\n\nAbstract: The  study  of  ignition  dynamics  is  important  for  a  wide  range  of  safety,environmental,  and transportation applications. This talkpresentsexperimental and numerical investigations of the processes  leading  to  ignition  of  reactive  gaseous  mixturesin  the  presence  of  ignition  sources-\u201dspecifically, hot surfaces and compressive devices. Anovel experimental techniqueis presented whichgeneratesrepeatable  high-temperature  particles  that  can  be  injected  intoa  reactive environment. An interferometer that makes useof large-angle dual birefringent prisms performshigh-speed  temperature  imaging  of  the  particle  injection  and  subsequent  ignition  and  flamepropagation of the reactive gas. The interferometer is a combination ofa differential and Mach-Zehnder  interferometer  and  is  highly  stable  in  aninfinite  fringe  configuration. Numerical  workanalyzesthechemical  kinetics  of  a  reactive  gaseous  mixture  adjacent  to  a  hot  surface.A simplified expression of the thermal boundary layer growth is presentedbased on a variation of the   Rayleigh   problem;   the   use   of   a   simplifiedexpression   rather   than   three-dimensional calculations  allows  us  to  use  adetailed  chemical  kinetic  mechanism  to  simulate  the  chemistry while  stillsaving  on  computational  cost.  Lastly, a  novel  experimentfor  compression  ignition testing  of  reactive  gasis  described.  The  experiment  makesuse  of  a  water  column  rather  than  a solid piston to compress a pocket ofreactive gas. The compression process leads to the formation of  a  multi-phase  mixture  consisting  of  reactive  gas,  water  droplets,  and  water  vapordue  to  the development  of Richtmyer-Meshkovand  Rayleigh-Taylor  instabilities.  Hydrocarbon-air  and hydrogen-oxygenreactive  mixtures  are  used  in  these  investigations  to  simulate  potentialexplosion hazards in the aviation and nuclear sectors.\n\nBiography: Stephanie  Coronel  is  a  postdoctoral  appointee  at  Sandia  NationalLaboratories  working  in  the Energetic Materials Dynamic & Reactive Science Department. Her research broadly focuses on abnormal  thermal  response  of  energetic  materials  as  well  as  diagnostic  development.  Prior  tojoining Sandia, she was  a postdoctoral scholar at GALCIT  (Caltech). She received her Ph.D. in Aeronautics  from  Caltech  in  2016,  where  she  workedfor  Professor  Joseph  E.

Custom-built robots have remarkably improved productivity, operational safety, and product quality. However, these robots are usually programmed for specific tasks in well-controlled environments, unable to perform diverse tasks in the real world. In this talk, I will present my work on building more effective and generalizable robot intelligence by closing the perception-action loop. I will discuss my research that establishes a tighter coupling between perception and action at three levels of abstraction: 1) learning primitive motor skills from raw sensory data, 2) sharing knowledge between sequential tasks in visual environments, and 3) learning hierarchical task structures from video demonstrations.\n\nThis lecture satisfies requirements for CSCI 591: Research Colloquium\n\nBiography: Yuke Zhu is a final year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at Stanford University, advised by Prof. Fei-Fei Li and Prof. Silvio Savarese.

In this talk, I will present novel algorithmic tools leveraging Lyapunov-based analysis, convex optimization, and risk measures to address robustness in robotic motion planning and decision-making under uncertainty. In the first part of the talk, by harnessing the theories of incremental stability and contraction, I will describe a unified framework for synthesizing robust trajectory tracking controllers for complex underactuated nonlinear systems with analytical bounded-input-bounded-output disturbance rejection guarantees. These results will be combined with computational tools drawn from semi-infinite convex programming to design real-time motion planning algorithms with certifiable safety guarantees. In addition, I will illustrate how to leverage these tools for sample-efficient model-based reinforcement learning with control-theoretic guarantees. In the second part of the talk, I will describe a framework for lifting notions of robustness from low-level motion planning to higher-level sequential decision-making using the theory of risk measures. Specifically, by leveraging a specific class of risk measures with favorable axiomatic foundations, I will demonstrate how to design decision-making algorithms with tuneable robustness properties. I will then discuss a novel application of this framework to inverse reinforcement learning for humans in safety-critical scenarios. The domains of aerial robotics and autonomous cars will be used throughout the talk as running examples.\n\nBiography: Sumeet Singh is a Ph.D. candidate in the Autonomous Systems Lab in the Aeronautics and Astronautics Department at Stanford University.

   "description": "Speaker: Jason Marden, University of California, Santa Barbara \n\nTalk Title: If agents could talk, what should they say?\t\n\nAbstract: The goal in networked control of multiagent systems is to derive desirable collective behavior through the design of local control algorithms. The information available to the individual agents, either through sensing or communication, invariably defines the space of admissible control laws. Hence, informational restrictions impose constraints on the achievable performance guarantees. The first part of this talk will provide one such constraint with regards to the efficiency of the resulting stable solutions for a class of distributed submodular optimization problems. Further, we will also discuss how strategic information exchange can help mitigate these degradations. The second part of this talk will focus on how agents should utilize available information to optimize the efficiency of the emergent collective behavior. In particular, we will discuss a methodology for optimizing the efficiency guarantees (i.e., price of anarchy) in distributed resource allocation problems through the design of local agent objective functions. Lastly, we will highlight some unintended consequences associated with these optimal designed agent objective functions -\u201c optimizing the performance of the worst-case equilibria (i.e., price of anarchy) often comes at the expense of the best-case equilibria (i.e., price of stability).\n\nBiography: Jason R.

   "description": "Speaker: Cunjiang Yu, University of Houston\n\nTalk Title: Manufacturing and Device Innovations of Rubbery and Curvy Electronics: Toward a Seamless Integration with Humans\n\nAbstract: While human tissues and organs are mostly soft and curvy; conventional electronics are hard and planar. Seamlessly merging electronics with human is of imminent importance in addressing grant societal challenges in health and joy of living. However, the main challenge lies in the huge mechanical mismatch between the current form of rigid electronics and the soft curvy nature of biology.\n\nIn this talk, I will first describe a new form of electronics, namely rubbery electronics, with skin-like softness and stretchability, which is constructed based upon elastic rubbery electronic materials. As the core basis of rubbery electronics, rubbery semiconductor has been developed through composite engineering based on commercial available materials and manufactured in a scalable and reliable manner. These manufacturing and device innovations set a foundation to realize fully rubbery electronics, circuits and sensors. In particular, rubbery transistors, logic gates, integrated electronics, sensors, smart skins, implants, neuro devices, and integrated function systems will be demonstrated. In the second part of the talk, I will introduce the invention and development of conformal additive stamp (CAS) printing, a novel, reliable and versatile manufacturing technology for developing 3D curvy electronics. Electronics with 3D curvilinear layouts, especially in the size range from millimeter to centimeter with accuracy of microns, are technically very challenge to build. The major hurdle lies in the lack of a proper manufacturing technology. CAS printing has therefore been developed to solve this long-standing manufacturing challenge. Systematic understanding and extensive employment of CAS printing for various curvy electronics will be presented to illustrate its manufacturing fidelity. Devices such as smart contact lens with integrated sensors and electronics for multiple diagnostic functions will be demonstrated. Soft and curvy electronics have open a new paradigm for personal healthcare, medical diagnosis, biological studies, human-machine interfaces, soft machines, etc.\n\nCunjiang Yu is currently the Bill D. Cook Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Houston, with joint appointments in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, and Biomedical Engineering. He completed his Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering within three years at Arizona State University in 2010 and was trained as a postdoc at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign before joining University of Houston in 2013. Dr. Yu was a recipient of NSF CAREER Award, ONR Young Investigator Award, MIT Technology Review 35 Top Innovators under the age of 35 -\u201c TR35 China, Society of Manufacturing Engineers Outstanding Young Manufacturing Engineer Award, Young Investigator Awards from American Vacuum Society and American Chemical Society, 3M Non-Tenured Faculty Award, and a few research and teaching awards at University of Houston.

ALAMO relies on (a) integer nonlinear optimization to build low-complexity models from input-output data, (b) derivative-free optimization to collect additional data points that can be used to improve tentative models, and (c) global optimization to enforce physical constraints on the mathematical structure of the model.  We present computational results and comparisons between ALAMO and a variety of learning techniques, including Latin hypercube sampling, simple least-squares regression, and the lasso.  We also describe results from applications in CO2 capture that motivated the development of ALAMO.\n\nHost: Dr. Joe Qin",

However, a similar process can also lead to pathological processes including deep vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, or myocardial infarction, among others. We have developed narrow mechanism-specific agents targeting the intrinsic pathway of coagulation and demonstrated that experimental thrombosis and platelet production in primates is interrupted by selective inhibition of activation of coagulation factor (F)XI by FXIIa. In this seminar, I will present new data on the role of the endothelium in inactivating FXI, as well as studies on whether inhibiting FXI is beneficial in a non-human primate model of sepsis. I will present our first data from our clinical trial on the safety of inhibition of FXI, and plans to test the efficacy of FXI inhibition in dialysis. The understanding of the mechanisms by which the intrinsic pathway of coagulation promotes thrombus formation may support the rationale for the development of selective, safe and effective antithrombotic strategies targeting FXI.\n\nOwen McCarty, a native of Rochester, received his B.S. in Chemical Engineering from SUNY Buffalo, and a Ph.D. degree in Chemical Engineering from Johns Hopkins University, where his research focused on the identification and characterization of tumor cell receptors for blood platelets and leukocytes.

   "description": "Speaker: Tyler Sorensen, Princeton University\n\nTalk Title: Reasoning About Heterogenous Computing\n\nSeries: CS Colloquium\n\nAbstract: Heterogeneous system designs have allowed computing efficiency to scale past fundamental constraints of transistors. Such systems are now the computation workhorses behind everyday technology, from speech recognition trained on clusters of GPUs, to efficient SoC designs in mobile phones. However, programming for these systems presents many challenges, specifically in orchestrating synchronization. Examining general purpose GPU (GPGPU) programming is a pragmatic start towards general heterogeneous reasoning, as GPGPU programming models expose hardware specialization and heterogeneous-aware constructs. In this talk, I discuss my work in this area, which has identified important areas of under-specification in GPGPU programming and laid the foundations for specification repairs. \n\nFirst, I will present work on testing memory consistency models, i.e. the rules governing fine-grained communication, for GPGPUs. This work exposed wide-spread confusion in the GPGPU community, including identifying programming errors in two Nvidia-endorsed textbooks. Second, I will present work on GPGPU forward progress models, which defines a progress abstraction that allows cross-vendor GPGPU global barrier synchronization. This can then be used in an optimization for GPGPU graph traversal applications, achieving over a 10x speedup on Intel and AMD GPUs. The talk concludes by showing that GPGPU reasoning is a natural foundation for future work targeting general heterogeneous programming.\n\nThis lecture satisfies requirements for CSCI 591: Research Colloquium\n\n\nBiography: Tyler Sorensen is a PostDoc at Princeton University in Professor Margaret Martonosi's architecture group working on designing new heterogeneous systems. He received his PhD from Imperial College London under the supervision of Dr. Alastair Donaldson. His thesis work involved rigorous reasoning about GPGPU programming, with an emphasis on fine-grained synchronization idioms. This work has been published widely (including two distinguished paper awards at PLDI'18 and\nFSE'17) and presented to major GPU vendors, including Nvidia, AMD and ARM.  Tyler received his MS/BS from University of Utah, where he received the 2014 Outstanding Senior Award. He has done internships at both Microsoft Research and Nvidia.\n\n\nHost: Jyotirmoy Deshmukh",

While this opacity partly stems from protecting intellectual property and preventing malicious users from gaming the system, it is also designed to provide users with seamless, effortless system interactions. However, this opacity can result in misinformed behavior among users, particularly when there is no clear feedback mechanism for users to understand the effects of their own actions on an algorithmic system. The increasing prevalence and power of these opaque algorithms coupled with their sometimes biased and discriminatory decisions raise questions about how knowledgeable users are and should be about the existence, operation and possible impacts of these algorithms. In this talk, I will address these questions by exploring ways to investigate users' behavior around opaque algorithmic systems. I will then present new design techniques that communicate opaque algorithmic processes to users and provide them with a more informed, satisfying, and engaging interaction. In doing so, I will add new angles to the old idea of understanding the interaction between users and automation by designing around algorithm sensemaking and transparency.\n\nThis lecture satisfies requirements for CSCI 591: Research Colloquium\n\n\nBiography: Motahhare Eslami is a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where she is advised by Karrie Karahalios.

   "description": "Speaker: Chuchu Fan, PhD Candidate, UIUC\n\nTalk Title: Verification and Synthesis Algorithms for Safe Autonomy\n\nAbstract: A single design defect can wreak havoc across thousands of deployed instances of autonomous systems or cyber-physical systems (CPS) such as self-driving cars, drones, and medical devices. Can rigorous approaches based on formal methods and control theory improve safety in autonomous systems by transforming the conventional trial-and-error paradigm? Verification and synthesis for typical models of real-world autonomous systems and CPS are well-known to be hard due to their high dimensionality, nonlinearities, and their nondeterministic and hybrid nature. In this talk, I will present new verification and synthesis algorithms which suggest that these challenges can be overcome and that rigorous approaches are indeed promising. The common ingredient underlying my algorithms is automated sensitivity analysis, which leads to semi-decision procedures for verification and synthesis, with soundness, completeness, and optimality guarantees. I will introduce the first bounded safety verification algorithm for nonlinear hybrid systems. This data-driven algorithm, which is the basis for the C2E2 tool, can also be used for compositional verification of networked and distributed autonomous systems. Then I will present my work on the DryVR framework, which is the first approach that can verify real-world CPS with incomplete or imprecise mathematical models. The final part of my talk will rely on symbolic sensitivity analysis with applications in control synthesis for large linear systems with disturbances. I will discuss successful applications in autonomous driving scenarios, powertrain control, circuits, and medical devices as examples to show the power of these tools for solving challenging problems in a wide range of engineering domains.\n\nBiography: Chuchu Fan is a Ph.D. candidate in the Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

   "description": "Speaker: Jeff Clune, University of Wyoming\n\nTalk Title: Understanding and Improving Deep Neural Networks\n\nSeries: CS Colloquium\n\nAbstract: Through deep learning, deep neural networks have produced state-of-the-art results in a number of different areas of machine learning, including computer vision, natural language processing, robotics and reinforcement learning. I will summarize three projects on better understanding deep neural networks and improving their performance. First I will describe our sustained effort to study how much deep neural networks know about the images they classify. Our team initially showed that deep neural networks are \"easily fooled,\" meaning they will declare with near certainty that completely unrecognizable images are everyday objects. These results suggested that deep neural networks do not truly understand the objects they classify. However, our subsequent results reveal that, when augmented with powerful priors, deep neural networks actually have a surprisingly deep understanding of objects, which also enables them to be incredibly effective generative models that can produce a wide diversity of photo-realistic images. Second, I will summarize our Nature paper on learning algorithms that enable robots, after being damaged, to adapt in 1-2 minutes in order to continue performing their mission. This work combines a novel stochastic optimization algorithm with Bayesian optimization to produce state-of-the-art robot damage recovery. Third, I will describe our recent Go-Explore algorithm, which dramatically improves the ability of deep reinforcement learning algorithms to solve previously unsolvable problems wherein reward signals are sparse, meaning that intelligent exploration is required. Go-Explore solves Montezuma's Revenge, considered by many to be a grand challenge of AI research. I will also very briefly summarize a few other machine learning projects from my career, including our PNAS paper on automatically identifying, counting, and describing wild animals in images taken remotely by motion-sensor cameras. \n\nBiography: Jeff Clune is the Loy and Edith Harris Associate Professor in Computer Science at the University of Wyoming and a Senior Research Manager and founding member of Uber AI Labs, which was formed after Uber acquired a startup he helped lead. Jeff focuses on robotics and training deep neural networks via deep learning, including deep reinforcement learning. Since 2015, a robotics paper he co-authored was on the cover of Nature, a deep learning paper from his lab was on the cover of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, he won an NSF CAREER award, his deep learning papers were awarded honors (best paper awards and/or oral presentations) at the top machine learning conferences (NeurIPS, CVPR, ICLR, and ICML), he was an invited speaker at five ICML and two NeurIPS workshops (including the NeurIPS Deep Reinforcement Learning Workshop), and he was invited to give a forthcoming ICML tutorial. His research is regularly covered in the press, including the New York Times, NPR, NBC, Wired, the BBC, the Economist, Science, Nature, National Geographic, the Atlantic, and the New Scientist. Prior to becoming a professor, he was a Research Scientist at Cornell University and received degrees from Michigan State University (PhD, master's) and the University of Michigan (bachelor's). \n\nHost: Yan Liu",

   "description": "Speaker: Owolabi Legunses, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n\nTalk Title: Evolution-Aware Runtime Verification\n\nSeries: CS Colloquium\n\nAbstract: The risk posed by software bugs has increased significantly as software is now essential to many areas of our daily lives. Runtime verification can help find bugs by monitoring program executions against formally specified properties. Over the last two decades, tremendous research progress has improved the performance of runtime verification. However, there has been very little focus on the benefits and challenges of using runtime verification during software testing. Yet, testing generates many executions on which properties can be monitored.\n\nIn this talk, I will describe my work on studying and improving runtime verification during testing. My large-scale study was the first to show that runtime verification during testing is beneficial for finding many important bugs from tests that developers already have. However, my study also showed that runtime verification still incurs high overhead, both in machine time to monitor properties and in developer time to inspect violations of the properties. Moreover, all prior runtime verification techniques consider only one program version and would wastefully re-monitor unaffected properties and code as software evolves. To reduce the overhead across multiple program versions, I proposed the first evolution-aware runtime verification techniques. My techniques exploit the key insight that software evolves in small increments and reduce the accumulated runtime verification overhead by up to 10x, without missing new violations.\n\nThis lecture satisfies requirements for CSCI 591: Research Colloquium\n\nBiography: Owolabi Legunsen is a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he works with Darko Marinov and Grigore Rosu. Owolabi's interests are in Software Engineering and Applied Formal Methods, with a focus on Software Testing and Runtime Verification. His research goal is to improve software reliability by helping developers find more bugs, find bugs faster, and find bugs more reliably. So far, his techniques and tools helped find more than 450 bugs in over 90 open-source projects. His research on runtime verification during software testing received an ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award at ASE 2016.

Bartlett, University of California, Berkeley\n\nTalk Title: Optimizing Probability Distributions for Learning: Sampling Meets Optimization\n\nSeries: Machine Learning Seminar Series\n\nAbstract: Optimization and sampling are both of central importance in large-scale machine learning problems, but they are typically viewed as very different problems. This talk presents recent results that exploit the interplay between them. Viewing Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithms as performing an optimization over the space of probability distributions, we demonstrate analogs of Nesterov's acceleration approach in the sampling domain, in the form of a discretization of an underdamped Langevin diffusion. In the other direction, we view stochastic gradient optimization methods, such as those that are common in deep learning, as sampling algorithms, and study the finite-time convergence of their iterates to an invariant distribution.\n\nJoint work with Xiang Cheng, Niladri S. Chatterji, and Michael Jordan.\n\nThis lecture satisfies requirements for CSCI 591: Research Colloquium. \n\n\n\nBiography: Peter Bartlett is a professor in the Computer Science Division and Department of Statistics and Associate Director of the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at the University of California at Berkeley.

   "description": "Speaker: Professor Suman Chakravorty , Aerospace Engineering, Texas A&M University\n\nTalk Title: A Decoupling Principle in Stochastic Optimal Control and Its Implications\n\nSeries: Center for Cyber-Physical Systems and Internet of Things\n\nAbstract: The problem of Stochastic Optimal Control is ubiquitous in Robotics and Control since it is the fundamental formulation for decision-making under uncertainty. The answer to the problem can be computed by solving an associated Dynamic Programming (DP) problem.  Unfortunately, the DP paradigm is also synonymous with the infamous  \"Curse of Dimensionality (COD)\", a phrase coined by the discoverer of the Dynamic Programming paradigm, Richard Bellman, nearly 60 years ago, to capture the fact that the computational complexity of solving a DP problem grows exponentially in the dimension of the state space of the problem.\n\nIn this talk, we will introduce a newly discovered paradigm in stochastic optimal control, called Decoupling, that allows us to separate the design of the open and closed loops of a stochastic optimal control problem with continuous control space. This \"Decoupled\" solution allows us to break the COD inherent in DP problems, while remaining near-optimal, to third order, to the true stochastic control. The implications of the Decoupled design are examined in the context of Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). We shall introduce two algorithms, called the Trajectory Optimized Perturbation Feedback Control (T-PFC), and the Decoupled Data based Control(D2C), for the MPC and RL problems respectively.  We shall also examine the consequences of the decoupling principle in partially observed/ belief space planning problems and present the Trajectory optimized Linear Quadratic Gaussian (T-LQG) algorithm.\n\nBiography: Suman Chakravorty obtained his B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering in 1997 from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras and his PhD in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2004. From August 2004- August 2010, he was an Assistant Professor with the Aerospace Engineering Department at Texas A&M University, College Station and since August 2010, he has been an Associate Professor in the department. Dr. Chakravorty's broad research interests lie in the estimation and control of stochastic dynamical systems with application to autonomous, distributed robotic mapping and planning, and situational awareness problems. He is a member of AIAA, ASME and IEEE. He is an Associate Editor for the ASME Journal on Dynamical Systems, Measurement and Control and the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters.\n\nHost: Mihailo Jovanovic",

However, these methods are very sensitive to selecting optimal hyperparameters. Frequently this is done by large scale experimentation often through grid or random searches. However, this is computationally expensive and time consuming. In this talk, I will present a few methods for learning hyperparameters during the training process. Thus, instead of training multiple networks with different hyperparameters, we only need to train one network without large grid search experiments. Our methods yield comparable, and often better, results, but at a faster experimentation rate.\n\n\nBiography: Kenton Murray is a 5th year PhD Candidate at the University of Notre Dame working with David Chiang on methods for improving Neural Machine Translation for Low Resource and Morphologically Rich Language Pairs. Prior to ND, he was a Research Associate at the Qatar Computing Research Institute focusing on Arabic Machine Translation.

This opens new opportunities to explore cyber robotics algorithms (sensors and human motor plant) and smart manufacturing algorithms (sensors and manufacturing equipment). These algorithms process motion sensor data and provide situation awareness for a wide range of applications. Smart management and training systems assist humans in day-to-day living routines, healthcare and sports. Machines benefit from smart monitoring in manufacturing, retail machinery, transportation, and construction safety. During my PhD Research, I have developed several approaches for motion analysis and classification. (1) A situation awareness system (SAS) for head-mounted smartphones to respond to user activities (e.g., disable incoming phone calls in elevators, activate video recording while car driving), (2) a filter for head-mounted sensors (HOS) to allow full-body motion capturing by removing interfering head-motions, (3) an Inertial Machine Monitoring System (IMMS) to detect equipment failure or degraded states of a 3D-Printer, and (4) a \"Smart Teaching System\" (STS) for targeted motion feedback to refine physical tasks. To capture real-world sensor data, we designed hardware prototypes or used state-of-the-art wearable technology. We developed novel sensor fusion algorithms, implemented feature extraction methods based on gist, statistics, physics, frequency diagrams and validated classifiers: SAS achieved high accuracy (81.5%) when distinguishing between 20 real-world activities. HOS reduced the positional error of a traveled distance below 2.5 % with head-mounted sensors for pedestrian dead reckoning applications. IMMS yielded 11-way classification accuracy over 99% when distinguishing between normal operation vs. 10 types of real-world abnormal equipment behavior. STS demonstrated that combining motion sensors and provide targeted feedback yield significantly improved golf swing training (3.7x increased performance score).",

Fimbres Weihs, PhD, CONACYT Research Fellow - ITSON, Dept. of Water & Environmental Sciences, Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Sonora\n\nTalk Title: Reducing the impacts of biofouling in RO through membrane modifications and hydrodynamics -\u201c Dealing with water scarcity in Sonora, Mexico\n\nAbstract: Water scarcity affects many regions of the world that already face issues with water supply. The state of Sonora, Mexico, is constantly afflicted by physical water scarcity, and this has led to social conflict in recent years. This work summarizes recent results of the CONACyT Fellowship Research Project at ITSON, which aims to improve the understanding of reverse osmosis membrane biofouling, specifically for the Pacific coast of Mexico, and develop strategies for reducing its impact on seawater desalination. Both experimental and numerical (CFD) efforts are underway. Through the analysis of the microbiological composition and seasonal variability of water from the Sea of Cortez, native seawater bacterium strain (Bacillus halotolerans MCC1) has been isolated and used for accelerated biofouling experiments. The suitability of iron nanoparticles (FeNPs) and graphene oxide (GO) for reducing biofouling has been tested. CFD simulations have been performed to test forced transient flow techniques for improving mass transfers in membrane modules, and for designing novel spacer geometries through 3D printing techniques. Moreover, the use of solar energy for desalination is being assessed and optimized. By means of this multi-prong approach, the aim is to reduce costs and make RO desalination an accessible technology for dealing with water scarcity in Sonora.\n\nBiography: Dr. Gustavo Fimbres Weihs received his B.Eng. in Chemical and Systems Engineering in 2002 from Monterrey Tech, Campus Monterrey, and his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering in 2008 from the University of New South Wales (UNSW), in Sydney, Australia, at the UNESCO Membrane Science and Technology Center. During his doctoral work he used numerical simulations of fluid dynamics (CFD) to analyze the flows within the membrane modules that are used for water treatment and desalination. He also worked on a desalination linkage project between the University of New South Wales and the European Union, as part of Framework Programme 6. From 2009 to 2014 he worked as a researcher for the Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies (CO2CRC) in Australia, where he led the research into CO2 Transport Networks and co-led the development of a techno-economic model for the analysis of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) projects. He has collaborated on consultancy and feasibility studies conducted by CO2CRC. He is currently a CONACYT Research Fellow at the Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Sonora (ITSON), where he leads collaborative research projects dealing with RO membrane biofouling (IHE-Delft), membrane modifications, solar energy use for desalination (CSIR-CSMCRI India) and CFD modelling of the hydrodynamics in membrane modules (UMP Malaysia).

   "description": "Speaker: Varun Jog, Assistant Professor, University of Wisconsin-Madison\n\nTalk Title: Analyzing Learning Algorithms: Perspectives from Information Theory and Optimal Transport\n\nAbstract: In this talk, we will analyze generalization and robustness properties of learning algorithms using tools derived from information theory and optimal transport. In statistical learning theory, generalization error is used to quantify the degree to which a supervised machine learning algorithm may overfit to training data. Leveraging recent work [Xu and Raginsky (2017)], we derive information-theoretic generalization error bounds for a broad class of iterative algorithms that are characterized by bounded, noisy updates with Markovian structure, such as stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD). We describe certain shortcomings of these information-theoretic bounds, and propose alternate strategies that rely on optimal transport theory. We show that results from optimal transport are well-suited to analyze not only generalization properties, but also robustness properties of learning algorithms.\n\nBiography: Varun Jog received his B.Tech. degree in Electrical Engineering from IIT Bombay in 2010, and his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) from UC Berkeley in 2015. Since 2016, he is an Assistant Professor at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department and a fellow at the Grainger Institute for Engineering at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.

   "description": "Speaker: F. Duncan Haldane, Princeton University\n\nTalk Title: Topological Quantum Matter, Entanglement, and the Second Quantum Revolution\n\nAbstract: While the laws of quantum mechanics have remained unchanged and always validated for the last eighty-five years, new discoveries about the exotic states that they allow, entanglement, and ideas from quantum information theory have greatly changed our perspective, so much so that some talk of a \"second quantum revolution\" that is currently underway. The discovery of unexpected \"topological states of matter\", and their possible use for \"topologically-protected quantum information processing\" is one of the important themes of these developments, and will be reviewed. Some of the early work in the 1980's that began to expose topological quantum matter has already earned Nobel Prizes, including the experimental discoveries of von Klitzing (Integer Quantum Hall Effect, Nobel 1985), and Stormer and Tsui (Fractional Quantum Hall Effect, Nobel 1998), the theoretical discovery of its description by Laughlin (co-laureate, 1998), and the work honored by the recent 2016 prize, which also occured in the 1980's. Given the surprising nature of subsequent recent developments, and the excitement they have generated, it seems likely that more will follow, especially if the current attempts to demonstrate \"braiding\" become successful. It is no exaggeration to say that, at least in Condensed Matter Physics, the concepts and language used to describe quantum states of matter have dramatically changed since about 1980 as a result of all these developments, in which the quantum property of \"entanglement\" plays a key role.\n\nBiography: Duncan Haldane, who shared the 2016 Nobel Prize for Physics with David Thouless and Michael Kosterlitz, is the Sherman Fairchild University Professor of Physics at Princeton University, a Fellow of the Royal Society of London, and a Foreign Associate of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. He is also a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Physical Society, and the Institute of Physics (UK).\nHe was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize for his theoretical work on \"topological states of matter\", including pioneering\nwork on unexpected (and initially controversial) \"topological quantum states\" of one-dimensional systems of magnetic atoms (for which he had previously received the 1993 Oliver Buckley Prize of the American Physical Society), and on the 1988 theoretical prediction of (ferromagnetic) topological insulators exhibiting the \"quantum anomalous Hall effect\" (finally observed experimentally many years later in 2013) for which he shared the 2012 Dirac medal of the International\nCenter for Theoretical Physics (Trieste) with Charles Kane and Shou-Cheng Zhang. His work helped to open up new directions and ways of thinking about quantum effects in condensed matter, and in recent years, \"topological quantum matter\" has grown into a very active experimental field which many believe may provide platforms for \"quantum computing\". He also initiated the field of \"topological photonics\". He currently works on \"quantum geometry\" in the \"fractional quantum Hall effect\".\nDr. Haldane received his Ph. D. in theoretical condensed matter physics from Cambridge University, under the direction\nand mentorship of Philip W. Anderson (Nobel Laureate in Physics 1977), and, before his appointment at Princeton University, worked at the Institut Laue-Langevin (Grenoble, France), the University of Southern California, Bell Laboratories, and the University of California, San Diego. Haldane was born in London in 1951, of mixed Scottish and Slovenian origins. Despite also having three forenames, he is unrelated to the famous biologist J. B. S. Haldane.\n\nHost: ECE-Electrophysics\n\nMore Info: https://minghsiehee.usc.edu/about/lectures/munushian/",

It has enabled the interconnection of objects and data to provide novel services that are changing the landscape of cities and communities worldwide.  The impact of these technologies are being felt when they improve and enrich the basic elements of our daily lives in our homes and workplaces.  During large scale disasters and unexpected events such as (fires, floods and earthquakes), these technologies can be morphed to gain improved situational awareness and better decision support for response personnel, agencies and citizens.  The ability to ensure resilient operation under small events and large disasters requires intelligent data collection and data exchange from diverse devices and data sources and interpretation of this information for higher level semantic observations.  Drawing on our recent efforts in smartspaces, smart firefighting and smartwater infrastructures , I will discuss the role of adaptive middleware and big data technologies to generate situational awareness.  The ability to combine novel technologies at multiple layers will open up new possibilities for resilient and scalable communities of the future. \n\nBiography: Nalini Venkatasubramanian is currently a Professor in the School of Information and Computer Science at the University of California Irvine. She has had significant research and industry experience in the areas of distributed systems, adaptive middleware, pervasive and mobile computing, cyberphysical systems, distributed multimedia and formal methods and has over 250 publications in these areas. As a key member of the Center for Emergency Response Technologies at UC Irvine, Nalini's recent research has focused on enabling resilient and sustainable communities using IoT/CPS technologies. In particular, her research addresses scalable observation and analysis of situational information from multimodal input sources; dynamic adaptation of the underlying systems to enable information flow under massive failures and the dissemination of  rich notifications to members of the public at large.  She is the recipient of the prestigious NSF Career Award, multiple Undergraduate Teaching Excellence Awards and best paper awards. Prof. Venkatasubramanian has served in numerous program and organizing committees of conferences on middleware, distributed systems and multimedia and on the editorial boards of journals. She received and M.S and Ph.D in Computer Science from the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. Her research is supported both by government and industrial sources such  as  NSF, DHS, ONR, DARPA, Novell, Hewlett-Packard and Nokia.

Evolutionary ecologists predict that behaviorally more flexible animals, especially those that learn and transmit information socially, will adapt most successfully. Crows and ravens (Corvus sp.) fit this idea of behaviorally flexible, generalist species with plenty of cognitive capacity; indeed, a number of Corvus species are now well-established in urban areas worldwide.\nBased on her thirty-year study of one population in Ithaca, New York, Clark will introduce the complex social world of American crows, how they do or don't fit the expected \"urban adaptor\" and also how even small cities are dynamic environments that continue to challenge them. Clark will also extend the discussion to crow species globally, the scientific and ecological value of this surprisingly diverse group, and the possibility that many crow species could disappear in the face of complacency and anthropogenic change.\nClark received her PhD in evolutionary biology at the University of Chicago.

The effects American communities are experiencing today \u2013 heat waves, sea-level rise, extreme rainfall, crop failures, and wildfires \u2013 will worsen over time.\nIn 2015, 21 youth plaintiffs filed suit against the federal government, arguing that by subsidizing fossil fuels and failing to control greenhouse gas emissions the United States is violating the children's constitutional rights to life, liberty, and property. The innovative case, Juliana v. United States, has survived two appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court, but government lawyers continue to fight to prevent the case from ever heading to trial.\nAt an Earth Day event hosted by UCLA School of Law's Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, Julia Olson, Executive Director and Chief Legal Counsel for Our Children's Trust, and lead attorney for the youth plaintiffs, will deliver an evening lecture to discuss this groundbreaking case. Olson's work has been profiled in 60 Minutes, The Washington Post, CNN, Vogue, NPR, and many other leading media outlets. University of Oregon Law Professor Mary Wood told The New York Times, \"she has built not just a case, but a movement.\"\nFollowing the lecture, UCLA Emmett Institute Faculty Director and Shapiro Law Professor Ann Carlson will moderate a discussion and Q&A with the speaker. A reception will precede the event.\nThis event is co-sponsored by UCLA Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, UCLA Sustainability, and the UCLA Sustainable LA Grand Challenge.\n",

   "description": "The Sign of the Cross (1932) \nIf one film was responsible for the grassroots movement that ended four years of \u201cimmoral\u201d pre-Code movies, it was not a film starring Mae West or Norma Shearer. It was a film about early Christians. The Sign of the Cross is based on a reverent 1896 play that Cecil B. DeMille had seen as a youth; in 1932, at 50, he wanted to complete the trilogy he had begun with The Ten Commandments (1923) and The King of Kings (1927). He also needed to revive his stalled career, but the odds were against him, as the Great Depression pushed Paramount (which he had co-founded in 1916) into bankruptcy.\nDeMille\u2019s use of symbolism, crowds, crane shots, dialectical montage, contrapuntal sound, music cues, multitrack mixing, and even silence is masterly, surpassing the masterpieces made in 1932 by Ernst Lubitsch, Rouben Mamoulian and Irving Thalberg. The Sign of the Cross has another distinction: it is the most graphically violent and sexually explicit feature yet released by a major studio. \u201cThis is the boldest censor-bait ever attempted in a picture,\u201d wrote Variety. Reports from packed theaters confirmed this. \u201cAt the Rialto,\u201d wrote the New York Times, \u201cwomen put their hands across their eyes to shut out the dreadful views; others fainted.\u201d\n35mm, b/w, 125 min.\nDirector: Cecil B. DeMille\n\nOnly Yesterday (1933) \nOnly Yesterday made a star of an unknown stage actress, Margaret Sullavan, and presented the story of an unwed mother who is both self-determining and unrepentant. And it was one of the first Hollywood features to depict a gay couple, albeit in an incidental manner. Only Yesterday opens with a harrowing depiction of the 1929 stock market crash, the finale of the 1931 book from which Universal borrowed the title. That book treated the 1920s as a distant, regrettable period, the attitude of many pre-Code films, but John Stahl looks at the jazz era with less disdain, basing his film on the wistful Stefan Zweig novel, Letter from an Unknown Woman.\nWhile 1933 had seen a flurry of flagrantly gay characters, Only Yesterday is the only Hollywood film (of its time) to present a gay couple as a matter of fact. Franklin Pangborn is an interior designer who brings his handsome partner (Barry Norton) to a penthouse party. While these characters are supposed to show the decadence of the twenties, they are sympathetically presented.\nOnly Yesterday was a box office success, one of Universal\u2019s few in 1933, but producer Carl Laemmle Jr. had to fight the Studio Relations Committee (the Production Code office) to retain its gay characters and its heroine\u2019s independence. These plot elements would have been impossible to film a year later, after the Code had been reconstituted. Indeed, the film\u2019s reissue was repeatedly rejected by the Production Code Administration in the mid- to late \u201930s.\n35mm, b/w, 103 min.\nDirector: John Stahl\n",

In a generation that lives so far from its original native roots, the Black April Commemoration event is especially significant because we strongly believe that heritage and culture are integral parts of the Vietnamese identity.\nBy commemorating this monumental event in Vietnamese history, we hope to remind everyone of how much our ancestors have sacrificed to come to America and strive for better opportunities for themselves and their children. Ultimately, we want to shed light on the many diverse perspectives of those affected by the war and bring about a memorable, personal, and enlightening experience to all.\n\u00a0\nTraditionally, the commemoration event features a combination of the following:\n\n\nFree dinner\nPanel of community speakers\nHistory showcase (art, photographs, poems)\nCandle lighting ceremony\n\n",

UCLA - a twig no more. Come back to campus and celebrate with fellow Bruins.
