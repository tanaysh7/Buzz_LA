For USC, this is a stepping stone; however, USC has often failed to provide the necessary resources and guidance that first-generation students need in order to more easily navigate the college system.\u00a0\n\r\nThe recent admission scandals reminded first-generation college students of the many inequities that exist amongst the undergraduate student body. Not only are first-generation college students responsible for figuring out how to get access to higher education, but they are also left with the burden of navigating the system once they get in\u2014a system that was not built for them.\n\r\nAs the community of first-generation students continues to grow\u00a0at USC, so does the need for more resources for this specific community. For instance, previous USC student leaders have advocated for additional resources, such as the need for physical space (first gen office), more first gen scholarships, and more program initiatives. In the past, the concerns of the community have not been taken into serious consideration and have often been overlooked.\u00a0\n\r\nTherefore, the First Generation Student Union invites the USC community to stand in solidarity with the First Generation community. Now, more than ever, it is crucial to rally for empowerment and to remind USC that they are not just another statistic, and that first-generation college students do belong. The rally will provide an opportunity for first-gen students to voice their concerns, share their experiences, as well as provide space for allies to show their support.\u00a0\n\r\nThe first generation college students are here, we care, and we invite the administration to hear students\u2019 concerns and goals for the future.\n\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact:\r\nValentin Avila, avilaval@usc.edu\r\nMiriam Antonio, mantonio@usc.edu\n",

Protein deamidation is the simplest post-translational modification and interestingly is catalyzed by a group of key metabolic enzymes known as glutamine amidotransferases. Herpesviruses encode pseudoenzymes or bona fide deamidases to promote deamidation and regulate fundamental biological processes, thus providing excellent model systems to interrogate roles of protein damidation. \nCurrently, research in Dr. Feng\u2019s laboratory is directed to probe the biological function of deamidation in coupling fundamental biological processes to metabolic status. Dr. Feng\u2019s research is primarily supported by grants from NIDCR, NCI and NIAID. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n",

        "description": "Dr. Katie Witkiewitz is a Regents\u2019 Professor of Psychology at the University of New Mexico with a joint appointment at the Center on Alcoholism, Substance Abuse, and Addictions. The underlying theme of her research is the development of empirically-based models of addiction, with an emphasis on applying advanced quantitative research methods to better understand changes in addictive behavior over time. \nDr. Witkiewitz is also a licensed clinical psychologist and has worked extensively on the development of a theoretical model of biopsychosocial influences on alcohol and drug relapse. She has conducted numerous empirical studies on the prediction of alcohol and drug relapse following treatment for substance use disorders, mechanisms of successful alcohol treatment outcomes, as well as the development of interventions to treat addiction. \nHer research has been supported by grants from the National Institute on Mental Health, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the National Cancer Institute, totaling over $20 million in research funding since 2004. \u00a0\u00a0\nAlcohol use is highly prevalent in society and, yet, only a minority of individuals develop problems with alcohol. Of those who develop problems with alcohol it is commonly believed that abstinence is the only option for successful functioning, however most people who develop problems with alcohol are not interested in abstaining from alcohol. The focus on abstinence as the only available option has created a treatment gap, whereby the majority of individuals with alcohol use disorder never receive treatment. \nThe current talk will provide data on the prevalence of alcohol use disorder, the possibility of drinking reduction as a treatment goal, the sustainability of reductions in drinking up to 3 years following treatment, and discuss alternative treatment options for drinking reduction. \n",

More precisely, we construct an open version of symplectic mapping torus of a symplectomorphism and distinguish it from the mapping torus of the identity as a (graded) Liouville manifold. As an application, we obtain pairs of diffeomorphic Liouville domains with the same symplectic cohomology groups, but that are different as open symplectic manifolds.\n",

        "description": "Two hundred years ago, on a dark and stormy night in Switzerland, a group of young English intellectuals challenged one another to invent a frightening story. \nEighteen-year-old Mary Shelley\u2014the daughter of political philosopher William Godwin and pioneering feminist writer Mary Wollstonecraft\u2014devised the most horrific tale, which in its many forms forever altered and continually haunts the landscape of literature and popular imagination.\nConsidered among the first sci-fi stories in the form of a novel,\u00a0Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus,\u00a0documents the consequences of Victor Frankenstein\u2019s quest to assemble from corpses and reanimate a creature of his own design. \nOn display here are illustrated versions of the novel, several representations of the many new creations, re-creations, and miscreations of Frankenstein\u2019s creature that followed the original, and examples of the scientific and literary works that inspired Shelley.\u00a0\nTo celebrate the bicentennial anniversary of Frankenstein\u2019s publication, the USC Libraries are partnering with Visions & Voices and schools across campus for a live, multimedia performance on April 4 at 7:30 p.m. on the front steps of Doheny Memorial Library.

Regression models with\nincomplete interactive or polynomial effects are a particularly important example because they are among the most common analyses in behavioral science research applications. In the context of single-level regression, fully Bayesian (model- based) imputation approaches have shown great promise with these popular analysis models. This talk will introduce attendees to model-based imputation for moderated regression analyses, including extensions of the procedure to multilevel models with random coefficients and non-linear terms.\n",

Is it more likely for a simple closed geodesic on X to be separating or non-separating? How much more likely? In her thesis, Mirzakhani gave very precise answers to these questions. One can ask analogous questions for square-tiled surfaces of genus 2 with one horizontal cylinder. Is it more likely for such a square-tiled surface to have separating or non-separating horizontal core curve? How much more likely? Recently, Delecroix, Goujard, Zograf, and Zorich gave very precise answers to these questions. Surprisingly enough, their answers were exactly the same as the ones in Mirzakhani\u2019s work. In this talk we explore the connections between these counting problems, showing they are related by more than just an accidental coincidence.\n",

        "description": "A Woman\u2019s Voice in the House: Gender Composition and its Consequences in Committee Hearings\nDo increasing numbers of women in Congress lead to more representation of women\u2019s voices during the legislative process? Using committee hearing transcripts from 1995-2017, Pamela analyzes how increasing the proportions of women interacts with measures of perceived power to affect a member\u2019s participation in their committee by gender.\nIn line with extant findings emphasizing the moderating effects of institutions, she finds that increasing the proportions of women positively affects participation among majority-party and senior-ranking women. She then investigates the effect on measures of influence.\nBoth women and men are less likely to interrupt others when women\u2019s proportion on a committee increases. Further, women are more likely to stay on the same topic as other women, while men are likely to change topics introduced by women. The results show that increasing proportions of women work together with individuals\u2019 power status to increase women\u2019s voice and shift power dynamics within Congress.\nPamela\u00a0Ban\u00a0is assistant professor of political science at University of California San Diego. She\u00a0focuses on electoral politics, legislatures, political parties, and how these institutions influence the behavior of political actors.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She received a PhD in Political Economy and Government from Harvard University in 2018 and a BA in Applied Mathematics from Harvard University in 2012.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n*Political Institutions & Political Economy\n",

        "description": "Two hundred years ago, on a dark and stormy night in Switzerland, a group of young English intellectuals challenged one another to invent a frightening story. \nEighteen-year-old Mary Shelley\u2014the daughter of political philosopher William Godwin and pioneering feminist writer Mary Wollstonecraft\u2014devised the most horrific tale, which in its many forms forever altered and continually haunts the landscape of literature and popular imagination.\nConsidered among the first sci-fi stories in the form of a novel,\u00a0Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus,\u00a0documents the consequences of Victor Frankenstein\u2019s quest to assemble from corpses and reanimate a creature of his own design. \nOn display here are illustrated versions of the novel, several representations of the many new creations, re-creations, and miscreations of Frankenstein\u2019s creature that followed the original, and examples of the scientific and literary works that inspired Shelley.\u00a0\nTo celebrate the bicentennial anniversary of Frankenstein\u2019s publication, the USC Libraries are partnering with Visions & Voices and schools across campus for a live, multimedia performance on April 4 at 7:30 p.m. on the front steps of Doheny Memorial Library.

        "description": "An immersive and enthralling journey through the Sonoran Desert on the U.S.-Mexico border, EL MAR LA MAR weaves together harrowing oral histories from the area with hand-processed 16mm images of flora, fauna and items left behind by travelers. Subjects speak of intense, mythic experiences in the desert: A man tells of a fifteen-foot-tall monster said to haunt the region, while a border patrolman spins a similarly bizarre tale of man versus beast. A sonically rich soundtrack adds to the eerie atmosphere as the call of birds and other nocturnal noises invisibly populate the austere landscape.\nEmerging from the ethos of Harvard\u2019s Sensory Ethnography Lab, J.P. Sniadecki\u2019s attentive documentary approach mixes perfectly with Joshua Bonnetta\u2019s meditations on the materiality of film. Together, they\u2019ve created an experience of the border region like nothing you\u2019ve seen, heard or felt before.\nProvided courtesy of Cinema Guild. Not rated. Running time: 94 minutes. In English and Spanish, with English subtitles.\nSELECT FESTIVALS & AWARDS\nOfficial Selection - Berlin International Film Festival, 2017\r\nOfficial Selection - San Francisco International Film Festival, 2017\r\nOfficial Selection - New York Film Festival, 2017\r\nOfficial Selection - BFI London Film Festival, 2017\r\nOfficial Selection - Vienna International Film Festival, 2017\r\nOfficial Selection - Chicago International Film Festival, 2017\r\nOfficial Selection - AFI FEST, 2017\r\nOfficial Selection - International Documentary Festival Amsterdam, 2017\r\nWinner - Caligari Film Award, Berlin International Film Festival\r\nWinner - Best Film, Dokufest Kosovo\r\nWinner - Best Film, Curitiba International Film Festival Winner- Universities Prize, lndielisboa\nAbout the Guest:\nJ.P. Sniadecki (b. 1979) works between China and the United States as an artist and anthropologist whose films explore collective experience, sensory ethnography, and the possibilities of cinema. His work is in the permanent collection of New York's Museum of Modern Art and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and has been exhibited at the Shanghai Biennale, the Whitney Biennale, the Shenzhen Biennale, the Centre George Pompidou and the Guggenheim, as well as at international film festivals, such as Berlin, BFI London, Locarno, New York, AFI, Viennale, Mar del Plata, and Beijing Independent Film Festival. Co-founder of the traveling screening series \"Cinema on the Edge,\" which showcases independent Chinese film, he has written articles for Cinema Scope and Visual Anthropology Review and the edited volume DV-Made China.

They entered the literature under the guise of the Demazure character formula --- a generalization of the Weyl character formula --- and were later shown to give a nonnegative expansion of Schubert polynomials. Much like their Schur and Schubert cousins, key polynomials have enjoyed a wide array of enumerative constructions over the years since their discovery.\u00a0 However, while the Schur polynomials have the much celebrated Littlewood-Richardson rule, and meanwhile an analog of the Pierri rule is known for Schubert polynomials, the structure constants of key polynomials remain a mystery.\n",

First, under certain assumptions on the set to which this signal belongs (satisfied, for example, when this set is an intersection of elliptical cylinders, or the unit ball of the spectral norm in the space of matrices) and on the norm used to measure the estimation error, we construct a linear estimate of the recovered signal which is \"nearly optimal\u2019\u2019 among all estimates (linear or non-linear) in terms of expected loss in the worst case.\nThese results are an extension of traditional results (e.g., Pinsker 1980 and Donoho, Liu and MacGibbon, 1990) that impose much more restrictive assumptions on the signal set.\nWe will then present a simple generic non-linear estimator and show that, in some \"favorable cases,\" this proposed estimate is nearly optimal in the minimax sense.\n",

Newly commissioned works will reflect the extraordinary skills of dancers who move between contemporary movement, hip hop groove, and classical ballet.

Working for clients like HBO, General Mills, and the Kresge Foundation, he brings food, comedy, and interactive storytelling to events for groups as small as 25 and as large as 5000+. He is also a producer/writer of his own comedy cooking show, The Peoples Cook, and a veteran of stages all over the world, touring the planet as producer/director, performance trickster, and speaker on issues such as mixed-race consciousness, food politics, and the power of the Fool to change the world. A Pushcart-nominated writer, his work has appeared in outlets including NPR, the L.A. Times, Asian American Literary Review, and The Wandering Song: Central American Writing in the United States. He is also a national poetry-slam champion who has featured at venues such as the Nuyorican Poets Caf\u00e9, the Chicago Theatre, Def Poetry Jam, the Smithsonian, and South by Southwest. Swimming Pool Party is part of a larger project by Karimi entitled Champion Swimmer. (Instagram, Twitter, USC MFA profile, Vimeo)\n\nRich Diltz is a creative artist based in Sacramento, CA. His specialties include airbrush, body painting, murals, and textile art. He also enjoys, and has experience in, puppetry, music performance, and interactive art. He has performed his work and organized teams at Disney World, Universal Studios, and the TV show Hollywood's Sexiest Jobs. His clients include many of the biggest names in Silicon Valley and the tech industry. He has been happily married for over 25 years and has two amazing kids. Current projects include indoor mermaids, spinning glow-in-the-dark mostly naked circus performers, forms of torture, dancing nocturnal animals, graffiti walls, and Bar Mitzvahs.\n\nGingee is a DJ/producer, percussionist, and vocalist known for her unique take on global bass. Her work reflects the sounds and cultures she has been exposed to growing up in Los Angeles, as well as the musical world of her Filipino ancestors and beyond. Her productions incorporate the sounds of percussion instruments such as the kulintang (gongs native to the Philippines), kettle drum, and cowbells with rap and poetry. Her 2015 EP, Tambol, made waves in the global music community and she recently released Solstice/Equinox, a four-part series of EPs that was released on every solstice and equinox throughout 2018.\n\nArshia Fatima Haq works across various mediums, including film, visual art, performance and sound, and is currently exploring themes of embodiment and mysticism, particularly within the Islamic Sufi context. Her body of work stems from the complexities of inhabiting multiple personas: woman, Muslim, immigrant, citizen, insider, outsider. She challenges and celebrates the socio-cultural and religious iconography she was raised with, and works with the kaleidoscopic varieties of aesthetic expression in the Muslim world that are marginalized both by conservative Islam and the Western imagination. Her work is conceptualized in feminist modes without reference to the Western feminist model, and narrative threads include migration, celebration, warfare, nostalgia, homeland, and borders, often within realms of Islamic influence, through lenses of traditional forms and kaleidoscopic reinventions of pop culture. Haq is the founder of Discostan, a collaborative decolonial project working with cultural production from the SWANA region.\n\nRocio Navarro is a sociologist, artist, and water healer. Over the last four years, she has helped over 300 people in the water, taking them through transformative experiences awakening to the whispers of the heart and soul. She has worked with couples having children; artists awakening their innermost creativity; individuals regaining intimacy and connection with themselves and loved ones; sufferers of PTSD, depression, and anxiety; and seekers of hidden potential and life dreams. Water healing is performed in a shallow body of temperature-controlled water and combines and integrates aspects of Watsu, Aguahara, Cranio-Sacral, Reiki, Sound, Cymatics, Epigenetics, and Energetics. Navarro provides individual and group sessions for people throughout Southern California, and occasionally does work with Tibetan bowls for sound and water healing sessions.\n\nSick Delicious (Alex \u201cJojo\u201d Guaring) creates visuals that are inspired by living in Southern California and draw from skate culture, street art, and underground music scenes such as hip hop and electronic. His art evolved from illustration to computer graphics, and today he focuses on motion design and live visuals for events. Mashing up hand-drawn and digital techniques to create a surreal psychedelic experience, his work has been showcased at events and venues such as Coachella and Grand Performances, and he has become a go-to designer within the Los Angeles art and music community. In collaboration with musical artist Gingee, he filters Filipino and American cultures through a modern audio-visual style that serves as a bridge between traditional and contemporary cultures, and inspires audiences to connect with their roots.\n\nHarry Waters Jr. created the role of Belize in the first production of Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes in 1991. He is most famous for portraying Marvin Berry in Back to the Future (1985), which earned him a gold record for his rendition of \u201cEarth Angel.\u201d Born in Tulsa, OK, and raised in Denver, CO, Waters attended Princeton University and received his MFA in Directing from University of Wisconsin-Madison. He worked as an actor in New York City on and off Broadway for many years, and has directed numerous productions around the Twin Cities and worked as a facilitator for the Many Voices\u00a0Roundtable at The Playwrights' Center. The professor and recent chair of the Theatre and Dance Department at Macalester College is currently working with his son, Jordon Waters, on WING IT, inspired by the tale of Icarus and Daedalus and continuing their performative conversations about fathers, sons, and sexual identity.\n\nAdditional Links:\nUSA Swimming Foundation: Constraints Impacting Minority Swimming Participation (Report)\n\r\nPresented by USC Visions and Voices: The Arts and Humanities Initiative.

How were cities regulated and spatialized in the political imagination? How did literary works and theatrical productions or maps and gazetteers contribute to the formation of cities? How might early modern representations of cities\u2014both what they include and what they pass over in silence\u2014unsettle our present-day assumptions about the nature of urban space or the experience of urban life? How did goods and knowledge circulate through urban spaces? What new perspectives on urban areas do studies of social margins, gender, and liminal spaces open up? What categories and concepts are most useful for understanding the complex realities of the early modern Japanese city and its representation in diverse texts and documents?\nThis two-day workshop, which will combine presentations, discussions, and readings of original archival materials, will deepen and expand our understanding of early modern Japanese cities in various literary representations, theatrical works, historical documents, and government regulations.\u00a0At the same time, we hope to use this interdisciplinary forum to explore the state and future of early modern studies and elaborate on new methodologies.\nPresenters \nDavid Atherton (Harvard University) \nWilliam Fleming (UCSB) \nThomas Gaubatz (Northwestern University) \nRobert Goree (Wellesley University) \nYoshida Nobuyuki\uff08Professor Emeritus, Tokyo University\uff09\u3000*Workshop instructor\nYoshida Yuriko (Tokyo University of Foreign Studies)\nFabio Rambelli (UCSB) \nLuke Roberts (UCSB) \nSatoko Shimazaki (University of Southern California)\nAmy Stanley (Northwestern University) \nAnne Walthall (Professor Emerita, UC Irvine) \n\u00a0\nCo-Sponsored by the USC Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures\n\u00a0\n",

In collaboration with musical artist Gingee, he filters Filipino and American cultures through a modern audio-visual style that serves as a bridge between traditional and contemporary cultures, and inspires audiences to connect with their roots.\n\nHarry Waters Jr. created the role of Belize in the first production of Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes in 1991. He is most famous for portraying Marvin Berry in Back to the Future (1985), which earned him a gold record for his rendition of \u201cEarth Angel.\u201d Born in Tulsa, OK, and raised in Denver, CO, Waters attended Princeton University and received his MFA in Directing from University of Wisconsin-Madison. He worked as an actor in New York City on and off Broadway for many years, and has directed numerous productions around the Twin Cities and worked as a facilitator for the Many Voices\u00a0Roundtable at The Playwrights' Center. The professor and recent chair of the Theatre and Dance Department at Macalester College is currently working with his son, Jordon Waters, on WING IT, inspired by the tale of Icarus and Daedalus and continuing their performative conversations about fathers, sons, and sexual identity.\n\nAdditional Links:\nUSA Swimming Foundation: Constraints Impacting Minority Swimming Participation (Report)\n\r\nPresented by USC Visions and Voices: The Arts and Humanities Initiative.

To celebrate this milestone, they will offer a program showcasing the \u201cNew Movement\u201d\u2014movement that connects cultures through a diversity of movement practices and challenges the hierarchies of codified dance traditions. Newly commissioned works will reflect the extraordinary skills of dancers who move between contemporary movement, hip hop groove, and classical ballet. A pre-show discussion will explore the histories and cultures embodied within the different dance forms, while building bridges between American social dance such as hip hop and American ballet as developed by George Balanchine and others. A panel of choreographers will articulate how contemporary thought and practice have shaped a new generation of hybrid, collaborative dance artists.\n\nAdditional Links:\r\nUSC Kaufman School of Dance | Facebook, Twitter\n\r\nPresented by the USC Kaufman School of Dance.

How were cities regulated and spatialized in the political imagination? How did literary works and theatrical productions or maps and gazetteers contribute to the formation of cities? How might early modern representations of cities\u2014both what they include and what they pass over in silence\u2014unsettle our present-day assumptions about the nature of urban space or the experience of urban life? How did goods and knowledge circulate through urban spaces? What new perspectives on urban areas do studies of social margins, gender, and liminal spaces open up? What categories and concepts are most useful for understanding the complex realities of the early modern Japanese city and its representation in diverse texts and documents?\nThis two-day workshop, which will combine presentations, discussions, and readings of original archival materials, will deepen and expand our understanding of early modern Japanese cities in various literary representations, theatrical works, historical documents, and government regulations.\u00a0At the same time, we hope to use this interdisciplinary forum to explore the state and future of early modern studies and elaborate on new methodologies.\nPresenters \nDavid Atherton (Harvard University) \nWilliam Fleming (UCSB) \nThomas Gaubatz (Northwestern University) \nRobert Goree (Wellesley University) \nYoshida Nobuyuki\uff08Professor Emeritus, Tokyo University\uff09\u3000*Workshop instructor\nYoshida Yuriko (Tokyo University of Foreign Studies)\nFabio Rambelli (UCSB) \nLuke Roberts (UCSB) \nSatoko Shimazaki (University of Southern California)\nAmy Stanley (Northwestern University) \nAnne Walthall (Professor Emerita, UC Irvine) \n\u00a0\nCo-Sponsored by the USC Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures\n\u00a0\n",

There are at least 50 different types of soft tissue sarcoma which develop in the muscles, fat cells, blood vessels, tendons, nerves, the linking of joints or lymph vessels. This type of cancer represents approximately 25% of all adolescent and young adult cancers .Osteosarcoma and Ewing\u2019s Sarcoma are two of the most common bone sarcomas diagnosed in younger patients; osteosarcoma is the most common bone cancer. \nThe Symposium will offer new and practical information covering the spectrum of important issues in AYA sarcoma, including our current understanding of tumor biology; multi-modal therapy including surgery, radiation and chemotherapy; and survivorship and supportive care to improve quality of life. The Symposium will include a simulated \u201cTumor Board\u201d discussion of an actual patient that will demonstrate the importance of coordinated, team-based care. \nFinally, presentations by AYA sarcoma survivors will offer practical information and inspiration to all. Presenters will include experienced physicians and other clinical providers, academic researchers, and patient advocates. \nAudience participation is encouraged through interactive Q&A periods throughout the day.\u00a0 \n",

There is an incredible number of different styles of sundials. In mathematics, the geometry of shadows is called\u00a0 \"projective geometry\".\u00a0 The talk will feature some very old sundials, as well as more modern ones that use fractal geometry.\n__________________________________________\n\u00c9tienne Ghys is a French mathematician. His scientific contributions deal with the geometry and topology of dynamical systems. For instance, one of his results allows a better understanding of the famous Lorenz butterfly, a paradigmatic object in chaos theory. Working as a senior researcher in CNRS (French National Center for Scientific Research), he has been instrumental in the creation and development of the mathematics department in the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, in Lyon. More recently he has been involved in several actions towards the public dissemination of mathematics, for instance through the creation of an online journal aimed at a general public, or the production of mathematical movies. He received the Clay award for the dissemination of mathematics. His most recent book (A singular mathematical promenade) proposes a visual approach to the theory of singularities of planar curves. He has been elected Permanent Secretary of the French Academy of Sciences in January 2019.\nAn event co-organized by the USC Department of Mathematics and the Consulate General of France in Los Angeles, and graciously hosted by Professor Kelvin Davies, USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology/Ethel Percy Andrus Gerontology Center.\n\u00a0\n",

        "description": "Title: A method to develop a comic based on your research: From scientists, for scientists, and beyond.\nSpeakers:\u00a0\n\u2022 Jan Friesen, PhD, is an eco-hydrologist in the Department of Catchment Hydrology at the Helmholtz Centre of Environmental Research - UFZ in Leipzig, Germany.\r\n\u2022 Skander Elleuche, PhD, is a trained biologist and biotechnologist at Miltenyi Biotec GmbH in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany. \u00a0In 2018, he published his first popular science book that includes cartoon illustrations on \u201cMicrobes From Extreme Environments\u201d (in German).\nOverview: Scientists are increasingly challenged to communicate their work to broader, more varied audiences. Traditionally, scientists are trained to tell fact-based scientific stories. Although a carefully constructed scientific story may be crystal clear to other scientists in the same discipline, they are often inaccessible to broader audiences.\u00a0\nThis webinar will highlight a simple, flexible framework for translating a complex scientific publication into a broadly accessible comic format. Comics, by transporting information in a largely visual manner, can be easily understood by a wide variety of audiences. However, turning scientific content into a comic requires reducing and generalizing the content of scientific publications. The webinar will provide an overview of a framework that provides guidelines on how to develop a conceptual foundation, a scientifically-relevant setting and characters, as well as a detailed storyboard. \u00a0\nRegistration: https://bit.ly/2HtP0bt\nFor more information, please email Katja Reuter (katja.reuter@med.usc.edu) or NamQuyen Le (namquyen.le@med.usc.edu)\n",

From the Spanish missionary expeditions in the early 1500s to the Golden Age of Hollywood to the strange new world of social media, the collection of letters in\u00a0Dear Los Angeles\u00a0is a slice of life in L.A. through the years. The pieces are arranged by date\u2014January 1st to December 31st\u2014featuring selections from different decades and centuries. What emerges is a vivid tapestry of insights, personal discoveries, and wry observations that together distill the essence of the city.\nDavid Kipen\u00a0is the former literature director of the National Endowment for the Arts, and currently serves as book critic for\u00a0Los Angeles\u00a0Magazine and critic-at-large for\u00a0The Los Angeles Times\u00a0and teaches in the writing program at UCLA. Born and raised in Los Angeles, Kipen opened the Boyle Heights bookstore and lending library Libros Schmibros in 2010. The former book editor/critic of the San Francisco Chronicle and contributor to multiple volumes of California cultural history, Kipen holds a degree in literature from Yale University. \u00a0\nLynell George\u00a0is a Los Angeles-based journalist and essayist. She is the author of\u00a0No Crystal Stair African Americans in the City of Angelsand \u00a0After/Image: Los Angeles Outside the Frame, a collection of her essays and photographs. She won a 2018 GRAMMY for liner notes for \u201cOtis Redding Live at the Whisky A Go Go.\u201d\n",

Using mouse genetics and human pluripotent stem cells as models, we have systematically investigated the phenotypes and mechanisms underlying impaired neurogenesis in neurodevelopmental disorders. One of the proteins that we have been focusing on is Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), a brain-enriched RNA-binding protein. Functional loss of FMRP leads to Fragile X syndrome, the most common monogenetic form of inherited intellectual disability and the largest single genetic contributor to autism. We have discovered that FMRP regulates postnatal and adult neurogenesis and uncovered underlying mechanisms such as altered epigenetic state and mitochondrial dysfunction. Our work has unveiled novel therapeutic targets that may be used for treatment. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n",

The convener of this year\u2019s workshop is Robin Beck of the University of Michigan\u2019s Department of Anthropology and Museum of Anthropological Archaeology.\nEarly America refers to a time, a place, and a vast field of interaction. Its starting point has traditionally been defined by Columbus\u2019s 1492 arrival in the Western Hemisphere, though different dates pertain in different places, depending on when Europeans first intruded into local sequences: 1519, 1534, 1539, 1598, 1607, 1620, and so on. Regardless of the particular date, we all too often base our ideas of what is and is not early America on a seemingly Eurocentric foundation. Robust literatures in a variety of disciplines have challenged found-ing narratives of this sort, but those same disciplines conceive of and interrogate the tempo-ral limits of early America differently. Nowhere, perhaps, is the disconnect more pervasive than in the ways that archaeologists and historians approach these limits. Archaeology\u2014traditionally the realm of so-called prehistorians\u2014works toward foundational dates, while history\u2014with its emphasis on text\u2014works away from them. The methods and tools that enable scholarship in either direction are often difficult to transfer across the divide.\nThis workshop will invite archaeologists and historians of early America for a conversation about bridging such long-standing divides between our respective disciplines. How might archaeologists draw from the tools of history (narrative, for example) to better people the pasts we reconstruct through analyses of material culture? What are some of the practical challenges for archaeologists seeking to shift from a dependence on general typology to more historically grounded frameworks? How might historians better incorporate archaeological approaches into their own analyses and interpretations? How can they better use archaeological data, and how could archaeologists more effectively present such data to interested historians? How do the perspectives of Native historians and archaeologists contribute to these goals? We aim for richer, more inclusive narratives, ones that are not constrained by artificially truncated chronologies of early America.\nQuestions may be directed to Joshua Piker, Editor, William and Mary Quarterly, at\u00a0japiker@wm.edu.\nThe\u00a0WMQ-EMSI Workshops are sponsored by the University of Southern California-Huntington Early Modern Studies Institute (with financial support from the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, the Mellon Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Humanities) and the Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture and are hosted by the Huntington Library and the University of Southern California.\n",

        "description": "Management of pituitary tumors and related pituitary disorders is a rapidly changing field with novel medications, advances in surgical techniques and improvements in radiation oncology techniques. A multi-modal approach toward care is essential and many health care providers need to know fundamental information on diagnosis and treatment to effectively care for patients, refer appropriate patients and integrate themselves in the care of the patients for their long-term care and monitoring.\nMultiple lectures from specialists in neuro-endocrinology, neurosurgery, neuro-ophthalmology, radiation oncology and neuroradiology will present evidence-based and practical approaches toward the diagnosis and management of patients with pituitary tumors and related pituitary hormone disorders.\n",

        "description": "Continuing the tradition of dedication to providing a comprehensive and current update in the management of thyroid disease, USC presents The USC Peter A. Singer Thyroid\u00a0Symposium 2019. Much like the very first symposium organized by Dr. Singer, we seek to forster enthusiasm about thyroid care in an increasingly complex and evolving field.\u00a0\nFor this program, forward-looking perspectives are presented illustrating the current state of thyroid medicine and where we are likely to go from here. The clinical landscape of thyroid care is characterized by growing management options and individualized care. Potential options now abound for common conditions such as thyroid nodules, thyroid cancer, hypothyroidism, and Graves\u2019 disease.\nFor 2019, we tackle areas of current debate and newer data influencing patient management, including thyroid care in the internet age,TSH receptor antibody testing, comprehensive evaluation of thyroid nodules, molecular testing, and surgery for thyroid cancer. Presentations combining evidence-based medicine and clinical experience, challenging cases, and panel discussions with audience questions, will help inform practice decisions in an era of complex clinical problems.\nWe hope you enjoy the meeting!\n",

        "description": "Lymphedema is a progressive, chronic condition that affects a significant number of cancer survivors but also many in the general population. There is no true cure for lymphedema, but it can be managed wiht appropriate medical, surgical, and therapeutic approaches. Unfortunately, many patients receive inadequate treatment, are unaware of treatments available, and lack resources on where to seek help.\u00a0\nThis multi--disciplinary approach to lymphedema and lipedema allows patients to receive up-to-date treatment options, self-management techniques, and appropriate diagnostic testing for additional treatment plans.\u00a0\n",

        "description": "\u201cStructure and Function of Spliceosome\u201d\nAbstract: Pre-mRNA splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a huge protein-RNA complex composed of the U1, U2, U4, U5, U6 snRNPs and many non-snRNP related proteins. U1 snRNP plays a critical role in 5\u02b9 splice site recognition and is a frequent target of alternative splicing factors. These factors transiently associate with human U1 snRNP and are not amenable for structural studies, while their yeast homologs are stable components of U1 snRNP. \nWe have recently determined the structure of yeast U1 snRNP using cryoEM. The structure offers a framework to integrate a wealth of existing genetic and biochemical data regarding the structure and function of yeast U1 snRNP and the mechanism of 5\u2019 ss recognition. In addition, the yeast U1 snRNP structure and biochemical analyses based on the structure provided insight into the structure and function of these auxiliary human U1 snRNP proteins in alternative splicing in higher eukaryotes. \nFollowing the recognition of the 5\u2019 ss by U1 snRNP, at least 10 other spliceosomal complexes form sequentially in a splicing cycle. We have recently determined the cryoEM structure of the yeast P complex at 3.3\u00c5 resolution, providing insights into the 3\u2019 ss recognition, exon ligation, and the action of RNA helicase Prp22.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n",

        "description": "Speaker: Ian Miers, Cornell Tech\n\nTalk Title: Cryptography in context: Bitcoin, breaches, and security in the real world\n\nSeries: CS Colloquium\n\nAbstract: This talk will cover the design, implementation, and deployment of new cryptography to solve security issues that arise in real-world applications. Providing security for practically-deployed systems requires a new approach to cryptography, one that begins with the context in which cryptographic protocols will be used and reasons backwards in order to obtain the necessary security properties. This talk will cover two examples of this approach. First, I will take a detailed look at confidentiality for payments and how to solve the privacy failures of blockchain protocols such as Bitcoin. I will detail the design, implementation, and commercial deployment of Zcash, the first system to offer confidentiality while preserving public verifiability for cryptocurrencies. Next, I will explore cryptography in the context of securing data against breaches, considering the reality that attackers will gain access to cryptographic key material --- thus rendering traditional encryption ineffective. I will show how to use new applications of puncturable encryption to address these vulnerabilities for messaging and device encryption.\n\nThis lecture satisfies requirements for CSCI 591: Research Colloquium\n\n\n\nBiography: Ian Miers is a postdoctoral researcher at Cornell Tech working on computer security and applied cryptography. His research focuses on making systems secure by exploring cryptography in the context of real world problems. This includes Zerocoin and Zerocash, the first systems to provide strongly confidential payments on top of public blockchains and work improving secure messaging including attacks on Apple's iMessage protocol and new techniques for puncturable forward secure encryption. His work has been featured in The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Economist, and denounced in at least two editorials. He is one of the founders of Zcash, a privacy preserving cryptocurrency based on Zerocash.\n\nHost: Muhammad Naveed",

        "description": "Speaker: Dinesh Jayaraman, Postdoctoral Scholar/University of California, Berkeley\n\nTalk Title: Towards Embodied Visual Intelligence\n\nAbstract: What would it mean for a machine to see the world? Computer vision has recently made great progress on problems such as finding categories of objects and scenes, and poses of people in images. However, studying such tasks in isolated disembodied contexts, divorced from the physical source of their images, is insufficient to build intelligent visual agents. My research focuses on remarrying vision to action, by asking: how might vision benefit from the ability to act in the world, and vice versa? Could embodied visual agents teach themselves through interaction and experimentation? Are there actions they might perform to improve their visual perception? How might they construct visual plans to achieve long-term action goals? In my talk, I will set up the context for these questions, and cover some strands of my work addressing them, proposing approaches for self-supervised learning through proprioception, visual prediction for decomposing complex control tasks, and active perception. Finally, I will discuss my long-term vision and directions that I hope to work on in the next several years.\n\nBiography: Dinesh Jayaraman is a postdoctoral scholar at UC Berkeley. He received his PhD from UT Austin (2017) and B. Tech from IIT Madras (2011). His research interests are broadly in computer vision, robotics, and machine learning. In the last few years, he has worked on visual prediction, active perception, self-supervised visual learning, visuo-tactile robotic manipulation, semantic visual attributes, and zero-shot categorization. He has received an ACCV Best Application Paper Award (2016), a Samsung PhD Fellowship (2016), a UT Austin Graduate Dean's Fellowship (2016), and a Microelectronics and Computer Development Fellowship Award (2011). He has published in and reviewed for conferences and journals in computer vision, machine learning, and robotics, received a CVPR Outstanding Reviewer Award (2016), is as an Area Chair for NeurIPS (2018 & 2019).\n\nHost: Professor Rahul Jain, rahul.jain@usc.edu",

        "description": "Speaker: Xinyu Wang, UT Austing\n\nTalk Title: A unified program synthesis framework for automating end-user programming tasks \n\nSeries: CS Colloquium\n\nAbstract: Programming has started to become an essential skill for an increasing number of people, including novices without formal programming background. As a result, there is an increasing need for technology that can provide basic programming support to such non-expert computer end-users. Program synthesis, as a technique for automatically generating programs from high-level specifications, has been used to automate real-world programming tasks in a number of application domains (such as spreadsheet programming and data science) that non-expert users struggle with. However, developing specialized synthesizers for these domains is notoriously hard. \n\nIn this talk, I will describe a unified program synthesis framework that can be applied broadly to automating tasks across different application domains. This framework is also efficient and achieves orders of magnitude improvement in terms of synthesis speed compared to existing techniques. In particular, I have used this framework to build synthesizers for three different application domains and achieved up to 450x speed-up compared to state-of-the-art synthesis techniques. \n\nThis lecture satisfies requirements for CSCI 591: Research Colloquium. \n\nBiography: Xinyu Wang is a PhD candidate at UT Austin advised by Isil Dillig. He works at the intersection of programming languages, software engineering and formal methods. He is interested in developing foundational program synthesis techniques that are applicable to automating real-world programming tasks. \n\nHost: Chao Wang",

        "description": "Speaker: Dr. Andrew S. Gordon, Research Associate Professor of Computer Science and Director of Interactive Narrative Research at USC ICT\n\nTalk Title: Playing Story Creation Games With Logical Abduction\n\nSeries: AAAI@USC Lecture Series\n\nAbstract: Story Creation Games, such as Rory's Story Cubes and the Tell Tale card game, require players to invent creative and coherent narratives from a set of unconnected elements assembled by random chance, e.g., the throw of a die or the draw of a card. Often producing comical and entertaining storylines, these games also demonstrate the remarkable human capacity for sense-making, where one's knowledge and experience is used to explain the co-occurrence of novel combinations of observations. In this talk, I describe our recent efforts to build a computer program that could successfully play story creation games. We view this task as an interpretation problem, where the aim is to identify a coherent narrative where each narrative element plays a structural role. Our approach is to solve this interpretation problem using logical abduction, searching for sets of narrative assumptions that logically entail each of the given narrative elements. The search proceeds by backchaining from narrative elements through a knowledge base of narrative and causal axioms expressed as first-order definite clauses, unifying assumptions wherever possible. After finding connected solutions that entail the given set of narrative elements, the structure of the proof graphs are then used to generate the natural language text representation of the interpretation. In this talk, I demonstrate this approach in generating eight creative narratives given the same set of three Tell Tale cards, depicting a train, a baseball player, and the symbol of a heart. These examples demonstrate that logical abduction is well-suited to this task, but also underscore the enormous knowledge bottleneck that must be overcome to play this game with arbitrary cards. I contrast our approach with recent efforts to generate narrative text using deep neural networks trained with narrative corpora, and discuss whether these approaches fundamentally change the nature of this knowledge bottleneck. \n\nRSVP: https://forms.gle/FXMS1nJ8W3oqveYv8 \n\n\nBiography: Andrew S.

For example, in the environmental sustainability domain, the problem of protecting endangered wildlife from attacks (i.e., poachers' strikes) can be abstracted as a game between defender(s) and attacker(s). Applying previous research on security games to sustainability domains (denoted as Green Security Games) introduce several novel challenges that I address in my thesis to create computationally feasible and accurate algorithms in order to model complex adversarial behavior based on the real-world data and to generate optimal defender strategy. My thesis provides four main contributions to the emerging body of research in using machine learning and game theory framework for the fundamental challenges existing in the environmental sustainability domain, namely (i) novel spatio-temporal and uncertainty-aware machine learning models for complex adversarial behavior based on the imperfect real-world data, (ii) the first large-scale field test evaluation of the machine learning models in the adversarial settings concerning the environmental sustainability, (iii) a novel multi-expert online learning model for constrained patrol planning, and (iv) the first game theoretical model to generate optimal defender strategy against collusive adversaries. In regard to the first contribution, I developed bounded rationality models for adversaries based on the real-world data that account for the naturally occurring uncertainty in past attack evidence collected by defenders. To that end, I proposed two novel predictive behavioral models, which I improved progressively. The second major contribution of my thesis is a large-scale field test evaluation of the proposed adversarial behavior model beyond the laboratory. Particularly, my thesis is motivated by the challenges in wildlife poaching, where I directed the defenders (i.e., rangers) to the hotspots of adversaries that they would have missed. During these experiments across multiple vast national parks, several snares and snared animals were detected, and poachers were arrested, potentially more wildlife saved. The algorithm I proposed, that combines machine learning and game-theoretic patrol planning is planned to be deployed at 600 national parks around the world in the near future to combat poaching. The third contribution in my thesis introduces a novel multi-expert online learning model for constrained and randomized patrol planning, which benefits from several expert planners where insufficient or imperfect historical records of past attacks are available to learn adversarial behavior. The final contribution of my thesis is developing an optimal solution against collusive adversaries in security games assuming both rational and boundedly rational adversaries. I conducted human subject experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk involving 700 human subjects using a web-based game that simulates collusive security games.",

        "description": "Speaker: Mukund Raghothaman, University of Pennsylvania\n\nTalk Title: Precise Program Reasoning using Probabilistic Methods\n\nSeries: CS Colloquium\n\nAbstract: The enormous rise in the scale, scope, and complexity of software projects has created a thriving marketplace for program analysis and verification tools. Despite routine adoption by industry, developing such tools remains challenging, and their designers must carefully balance tradeoffs between false alarms, missed bugs, and scalability to large codebases. Furthermore, when tools fail to verify some program property, they only provide coarse estimates of alarm relevance, potential severity, and of the likelihood of being a real bug, thereby limiting their usefulness in software projects with large teams.\n\nI will present a framework that extends contemporary program reasoning systems with rich probabilistic models. These models emerge naturally from the program structure, and probabilistic inference refines the deductive process of the underlying system. In experiments with large programs, such probabilistic graphical representations of program structure enable an order-of-magnitude reduction in false alarm rates and invocations of expensive reasoning engines such as SMT solvers.\n\nTo the analysis user, these techniques offer a lens by which to focus their attention on the most important alarms and a uniform method for the tool to interactively generalize from human feedback. To the analysis designer, they offer novel opportunities to leverage data-driven approaches in analysis design. And to researchers, they offer new challenges while performing inference in models of unprecedented size. I will conclude by describing how these ideas promise to underpin the next generation of intelligent programming systems, with applications in diverse areas such as program synthesis, differentiable programming, and fault localization in complex systems.\n\nThis lecture satisfies requirements for CSCI 591: Research Colloquium. \n\nBiography: Mukund Raghothaman is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania.

For operations of many of these systems, noise is often viewed as being undesirable. However, the interplay between noise and nonlinearity in a system can result in significant response changes that can be beneficial to a systems performance. In this spirit, the work carried out to further our understanding on the constructive use of noise in a nonlinear system to realize noise-enhanced responses, noise-enabled stabilization, and noise-assisted response steering will be discussed. Efforts undertaken with partial control will be discussed. Representative physical systems that will be considered include coupled oscillator arrays at the micro-scale and macro-scale, flexible rotor systems, and pendulum systems. The findings of these studies are expected to be relevant to a variety of different nonlinear, mechanical and structural systems. Some thoughts on future directions in the realm of applied nonlinear dynamics will be presented to close the talk.\n\nBala Balachandran received his B.

However, many prior works on Internet services only focus on the security of an individual network layer in isolation, whereas the adversaries do quite the opposite -\u201c they look for opportunities to exploit the interactions across heterogeneous components and layers to compromise the system security. This gap leaves the privacy and security of billions of users as well as our critical infrastructure at risk.\nI aim to bridge this gap to build privacy-preserving and secure Internet services. In this talk, I will focus on two Internet services, the Tor network and the Public Key Infrastructure. I have uncovered new vulnerabilities in these services by taking a cross-layer approach to exploit the interdependencies across different network layers. I have demonstrated attacks in the wild (ethically) to evaluate the real effects of vulnerabilities. Consequently, I have built practical defenses that have received real-world deployment by the Tor Project which serves millions of users, and Let's Encrypt which is the world's largest Certificate Authority that has issued hundreds of millions of digital certificates.\n\nThis lecture satisfies requirements for CSCI 591: Research Colloquium. \n\nBiography: Yixin Sun is a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Princeton University.

        "description": "Speaker: Nandita Vijaykumar, PhD Candidate/Carnegie Mellon University\n\nTalk Title: Rethinking the Hardware-Software Contract: Enabling Practical and General Cross-Layer Optimizations\n\nAbstract: Layered abstractions in the computing stack are critical to building complex systems, but the existing *interfaces* between layers restrict what can be done at each level. Enhancing cross-layer interfaces--specifically, the hardware-software interface--is crucial towards addressing two important and hard-to-solve challenges in computer systems today: First, significant effort and expertise are required to write high-performance code that harnesses the full potential of today's diverse and sophisticated hardware. Second, as a hardware or system designer, architecting faster and more efficient systems is challenging as the vast majority of the program's semantic content and programmer intent gets lost in translation with today's hardware-software interface. Moving towards the future, these challenges in programmability and efficiency will be even more intractable as we architect increasingly heterogeneous and sophisticated systems. \n\nIn this talk, I will highlight my work [ISCA'15, MICRO'16, ISCA'18, ISCA'18] on how to design rich cross-layer abstractions that provide layered interfaces to directly communicate higher-level program semantics and intent from the application to the lower levels of the stack. In doing so, we can effectively bridge the so-called \"semantic gap\" between applications and computer systems, and enable a wide range of cross-layer optimizations in future systems with a single unifying interface. I will discuss how cross-layer approaches with these abstractions can significantly enhance (1) performance and efficiency by enabling the system to adapt to application characteristics and (2) programmability and portability by enabling application software to easily leverage diverse underlying hardware resources without specific knowledge of system details. For example, daunting aspects of programming GPUs can be made much simpler with a rich cross-layer programming abstraction. I will describe how such abstractions can be designed to be highly practical and low-overhead, requiring only small additions to existing abstractions.\n\nBiography: Nandita Vijaykumar is a Ph.D. candidate at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Prof. Onur Mutlu and Prof. Phillip Gibbons. She is also currently a visiting student at ETH Zurich. Her research focuses on the interaction between programming models, system software, and hardware architecture in an increasingly diverse compute landscape, with a focus on memory systems and modern accelerators like GPUs. She is excited about enabling cross-layer full-stack solutions to make future systems highly efficient and easy-to-program. She is the recipient of the Benjamin Garver Lamme/Westinghouse Fellowship at CMU. During her Ph.D., she has been fortunate to intern at Microsoft Research, Nvidia Research, and Intel Labs.\n\nHost: Professor Xuehai Qian, xuehai.qian@usc.edu",

        "description": "Speaker: Nima Fazeli, MIT\n\nTalk Title: Towards Robotic Manipulation, Understanding the World Through Contact\n\nAbstract: Why is robotic manipulation so hard? As humans, we are unrivaled in our ability to dexterously manipulate objects and exhibit complex skills seemingly effortlessly. Recent research in cognitive science suggests that this ability is driven by our internal representations of the physical world, built over a life-time of experience. Our predictive ability is complemented by our senses of sight and touch, intuitive state-estimation, and tactile dexterity. Given the complexity of human reasoning, skill, and hardware, it is not surprising that we have yet to replicate our abilities in robots. In order to bridge this gap, we must develop robotic systems that build their understanding and interpretation of the physical world through contact. Using experiments as tools, these Galilean Robots will distill their experiences into models of the physical world.\n\nIn this talk, I will present some of my work spanning the spectrum of analytical to fully data driven methodologies for model building and inference through contact. I believe that Galilean Robots need to master tools from this spectrum for intelligent and dexterous manipulation. First, I will discuss a methodology for the inference of contact forces and system parameters of rigid bodies systems making and breaking contact. I will then touch on data augmented contact models for controls as a medium between analytical and data driven techniques. I will show how a robot can learn the physics of playing Jenga using a hierarchical learning methodology purely from data. I will conclude the talk by providing perspectives on building Galilean Robotic systems that embody intelligent manipulation.\n\nNima Fazeli is a PhD student with the Mechanical Engineering Department at MIT, working with Prof. Alberto Rodriguez. His research focuses on enabling intelligent and dexterous robotic manipulation by developing novel tools combining analytical methods, machine learning, and cognition/AI. During his PhD, Nima has developed inference algorithms for robotic systems undergoing frictional contact, performed empirical evaluations of contact models, demonstrated data-augmented contact models for manipulation, and developed a robotic system capable of learning the physics of playing Jenga using a hierarchical learning methodology. Nima received his masters from the University of Maryland at College Park where he spent most of his time developing analytical and data-driven models of the human (and, on occasion, swine) arterial tree together with novel inference algorithms to diagnoses cardiovascular diseases. His research has been supported by the Rohsenow Fellowship and featured in outlets such as CBS, CNN, and the BBC. He looks forward to robots playing and learning alongside his grandchildren.\n\nThursday, April 4, 2019\n11:00 AM\nThe Laufer Library (RRB 208)\nRefreshments will be served at 10:45 AM.\n\nHost: AME Department",

        "description": "Speaker: Amy Babay, Johns Hopkins University\n\nTalk Title: Dependable Systems and Networks for a Complex World\n\nSeries: CS Colloquium\n\nAbstract: As our world grows more complex, the expectations we place on the networked systems running our society's infrastructure grow more demanding. In this talk, I will discuss two types of emerging demands and present infrastructure systems we have developed to meet those demands. The first part of the talk will focus on the demanding performance requirements brought by emerging highly interactive applications such as remote robotic manipulation, remote surgery, and collaborative virtual reality. These applications require communication that is both timely and highly reliable, but the Internet natively supports only communication that is either completely reliable with no timeliness guarantees (e.g. TCP) or timely with only best-effort reliability (e.g. UDP). We present an overlay transport service that can provide highly reliable communication while meeting the stringent timeliness requirements of these applications. The second part of the talk will address the demanding security and resilience needs of critical infrastructure services, in particular SCADA systems for the power grid, that are increasingly becoming exposed to malicious attacks. I will present our work building Spire, the first intrusion-tolerant SCADA system for the power grid that is resilient to both system-level compromises and sophisticated network-level attacks.\n\nThis lecture satisfies requirements for CSCI 591: Research Colloquium. \n\nBiography: Amy Babay recently completed her PhD in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University, where she was a member of the Distributed Systems and Networks Lab. Her research focuses on enabling new Internet services with demanding performance requirements and on building dependable critical infrastructure systems. Prior to starting her PhD, she gained experience with global overlay networks in the commercial world, working at LTN Global Communications. She is currently working to advance some of her research toward commercialization at Spread Concepts LLC.\n\nHost: Ramesh Govindan",

        "description": "Speaker: Mahsa Shoaran, Cornell University\n\nTalk Title: Ultra-Low-Power Neural Interfaces: from Monitoring to  Diagnosis and Therapy\n\nAbstract: Implantable and wearable medical devices are increasingly being developed as alternative therapies for intractable diseases. In particular, undertreated neurological disorders such as epilepsy, migraine, and Alzheimer's disease are of major public health concern around the world, driving the need to explore such new approaches. Despite significant advances in neural interface systems, the small number of recording channels in existing technology remains a barrier to their therapeutic potential. This is mainly due to the fact that simultaneous recording from a large number of electrodes imposes stringent energy and area constraints on the integrated circuits that interface with these electrodes. In this talk, I will first discuss an efficient compressive sensing framework for multichannel cortical implants. Next, I will present the design of our sub-microwatt per channel closed-loop seizure control device and both its in-vivo and offline performance. I will then discuss our latest work on the integration of machine learning algorithms for on-chip classification of neural data. Finally, I will give examples of how these results may be used towards designing new devices, to enhance the lives of millions of people suffering from disabling neurological conditions in future.\n\nBiography: Mahsa Shoaran is currently an Assistant Professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University. Prior to joining Cornell, she was a postdoctoral fellow in Electrical Engineering and Medical Engineering at the California Institute of Technology. She received her PhD from EPFL in 2015 and her B.Sc. and M.Sc. from Sharif University of Technology. Her research interests broadly include circuit, system, and algorithm design for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Mahsa is a recipient of the 2019 Google Faculty Research Award, the Early and Advanced Swiss National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowships, and the NSF Award for Young Professionals Contributing to Smart and Connected Health. She was named a Rising Star in EECS by MIT in 2015. \n\nHost: ECE-Electrophysics",

Coronel, Sandia National Laboratories\n\nTalk Title: Ignition Dynamics of Reactive Gaseous Mixtures\n\nAbstract: The  study  of  ignition  dynamics  is  important  for  a  wide  range  of  safety,environmental,  and transportation applications. This talkpresentsexperimental and numerical investigations of the processes  leading  to  ignition  of  reactive  gaseous  mixturesin  the  presence  of  ignition  sources-\u201dspecifically, hot surfaces and compressive devices. Anovel experimental techniqueis presented whichgeneratesrepeatable  high-temperature  particles  that  can  be  injected  intoa  reactive environment. An interferometer that makes useof large-angle dual birefringent prisms performshigh-speed  temperature  imaging  of  the  particle  injection  and  subsequent  ignition  and  flamepropagation of the reactive gas. The interferometer is a combination ofa differential and Mach-Zehnder  interferometer  and  is  highly  stable  in  aninfinite  fringe  configuration. Numerical  workanalyzesthechemical  kinetics  of  a  reactive  gaseous  mixture  adjacent  to  a  hot  surface.A simplified expression of the thermal boundary layer growth is presentedbased on a variation of the   Rayleigh   problem;   the   use   of   a   simplifiedexpression   rather   than   three-dimensional calculations  allows  us  to  use  adetailed  chemical  kinetic  mechanism  to  simulate  the  chemistry while  stillsaving  on  computational  cost.  Lastly, a  novel  experimentfor  compression  ignition testing  of  reactive  gasis  described.  The  experiment  makesuse  of  a  water  column  rather  than  a solid piston to compress a pocket ofreactive gas. The compression process leads to the formation of  a  multi-phase  mixture  consisting  of  reactive  gas,  water  droplets,  and  water  vapordue  to  the development  of Richtmyer-Meshkovand  Rayleigh-Taylor  instabilities.  Hydrocarbon-air  and hydrogen-oxygenreactive  mixtures  are  used  in  these  investigations  to  simulate  potentialexplosion hazards in the aviation and nuclear sectors.\n\nBiography: Stephanie  Coronel  is  a  postdoctoral  appointee  at  Sandia  NationalLaboratories  working  in  the Energetic Materials Dynamic & Reactive Science Department.

        "description": "Speaker: Yuke Zhu, Stanford University\n\nTalk Title: Closing the Perception-Action Loop\n\nSeries: CS Colloquium\n\nAbstract: Robots and autonomous systems have been playing a significant role in the modern economy. Custom-built robots have remarkably improved productivity, operational safety, and product quality. However, these robots are usually programmed for specific tasks in well-controlled environments, unable to perform diverse tasks in the real world. In this talk, I will present my work on building more effective and generalizable robot intelligence by closing the perception-action loop. I will discuss my research that establishes a tighter coupling between perception and action at three levels of abstraction: 1) learning primitive motor skills from raw sensory data, 2) sharing knowledge between sequential tasks in visual environments, and 3) learning hierarchical task structures from video demonstrations.\n\nThis lecture satisfies requirements for CSCI 591: Research Colloquium\n\nBiography: Yuke Zhu is a final year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at Stanford University, advised by Prof. Fei-Fei Li and Prof. Silvio Savarese. His research interests lie at the intersection of robotics, computer vision, and machine learning. His work builds machine learning and perception algorithms for general-purpose robots.

        "description": "Speaker: Sumeet Singh, PhD Candidate, Dept of Aeronautics & Astronautics, Stanford University\n\nTalk Title: A Real-Time Algorithmic Framework for Robust and Risk-Sensitive Planning and Decision-Making\n\nAbstract: Integrating autonomous robots into safety-critical settings requires reasoning about uncertainty at all levels of the autonomy stack. In this talk, I will present novel algorithmic tools leveraging Lyapunov-based analysis, convex optimization, and risk measures to address robustness in robotic motion planning and decision-making under uncertainty. In the first part of the talk, by harnessing the theories of incremental stability and contraction, I will describe a unified framework for synthesizing robust trajectory tracking controllers for complex underactuated nonlinear systems with analytical bounded-input-bounded-output disturbance rejection guarantees. These results will be combined with computational tools drawn from semi-infinite convex programming to design real-time motion planning algorithms with certifiable safety guarantees. In addition, I will illustrate how to leverage these tools for sample-efficient model-based reinforcement learning with control-theoretic guarantees. In the second part of the talk, I will describe a framework for lifting notions of robustness from low-level motion planning to higher-level sequential decision-making using the theory of risk measures. Specifically, by leveraging a specific class of risk measures with favorable axiomatic foundations, I will demonstrate how to design decision-making algorithms with tuneable robustness properties. I will then discuss a novel application of this framework to inverse reinforcement learning for humans in safety-critical scenarios. The domains of aerial robotics and autonomous cars will be used throughout the talk as running examples.\n\nBiography: Sumeet Singh is a Ph.D. candidate in the Autonomous Systems Lab in the Aeronautics and Astronautics Department at Stanford University.

        "description": "Speaker: Jason Marden, University of California, Santa Barbara \n\nTalk Title: If agents could talk, what should they say?\t\n\nAbstract: The goal in networked control of multiagent systems is to derive desirable collective behavior through the design of local control algorithms. The information available to the individual agents, either through sensing or communication, invariably defines the space of admissible control laws. Hence, informational restrictions impose constraints on the achievable performance guarantees. The first part of this talk will provide one such constraint with regards to the efficiency of the resulting stable solutions for a class of distributed submodular optimization problems. Further, we will also discuss how strategic information exchange can help mitigate these degradations. The second part of this talk will focus on how agents should utilize available information to optimize the efficiency of the emergent collective behavior. In particular, we will discuss a methodology for optimizing the efficiency guarantees (i.e., price of anarchy) in distributed resource allocation problems through the design of local agent objective functions. Lastly, we will highlight some unintended consequences associated with these optimal designed agent objective functions -\u201c optimizing the performance of the worst-case equilibria (i.e., price of anarchy) often comes at the expense of the best-case equilibria (i.e., price of stability).\n\nBiography: Jason R.

Seamlessly merging electronics with human is of imminent importance in addressing grant societal challenges in health and joy of living. However, the main challenge lies in the huge mechanical mismatch between the current form of rigid electronics and the soft curvy nature of biology.\n\nIn this talk, I will first describe a new form of electronics, namely rubbery electronics, with skin-like softness and stretchability, which is constructed based upon elastic rubbery electronic materials. As the core basis of rubbery electronics, rubbery semiconductor has been developed through composite engineering based on commercial available materials and manufactured in a scalable and reliable manner. These manufacturing and device innovations set a foundation to realize fully rubbery electronics, circuits and sensors. In particular, rubbery transistors, logic gates, integrated electronics, sensors, smart skins, implants, neuro devices, and integrated function systems will be demonstrated. In the second part of the talk, I will introduce the invention and development of conformal additive stamp (CAS) printing, a novel, reliable and versatile manufacturing technology for developing 3D curvy electronics. Electronics with 3D curvilinear layouts, especially in the size range from millimeter to centimeter with accuracy of microns, are technically very challenge to build. The major hurdle lies in the lack of a proper manufacturing technology. CAS printing has therefore been developed to solve this long-standing manufacturing challenge. Systematic understanding and extensive employment of CAS printing for various curvy electronics will be presented to illustrate its manufacturing fidelity. Devices such as smart contact lens with integrated sensors and electronics for multiple diagnostic functions will be demonstrated. Soft and curvy electronics have open a new paradigm for personal healthcare, medical diagnosis, biological studies, human-machine interfaces, soft machines, etc.\n\nCunjiang Yu is currently the Bill D. Cook Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Houston, with joint appointments in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, and Biomedical Engineering.

However, a similar process can also lead to pathological processes including deep vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, or myocardial infarction, among others. We have developed narrow mechanism-specific agents targeting the intrinsic pathway of coagulation and demonstrated that experimental thrombosis and platelet production in primates is interrupted by selective inhibition of activation of coagulation factor (F)XI by FXIIa. In this seminar, I will present new data on the role of the endothelium in inactivating FXI, as well as studies on whether inhibiting FXI is beneficial in a non-human primate model of sepsis. I will present our first data from our clinical trial on the safety of inhibition of FXI, and plans to test the efficacy of FXI inhibition in dialysis. The understanding of the mechanisms by which the intrinsic pathway of coagulation promotes thrombus formation may support the rationale for the development of selective, safe and effective antithrombotic strategies targeting FXI.\n\nOwen McCarty, a native of Rochester, received his B.S. in Chemical Engineering from SUNY Buffalo, and a Ph.D. degree in Chemical Engineering from Johns Hopkins University, where his research focused on the identification and characterization of tumor cell receptors for blood platelets and leukocytes.

        "description": "Speaker: Tyler Sorensen, Princeton University\n\nTalk Title: Reasoning About Heterogenous Computing\n\nSeries: CS Colloquium\n\nAbstract: Heterogeneous system designs have allowed computing efficiency to scale past fundamental constraints of transistors. Such systems are now the computation workhorses behind everyday technology, from speech recognition trained on clusters of GPUs, to efficient SoC designs in mobile phones. However, programming for these systems presents many challenges, specifically in orchestrating synchronization. Examining general purpose GPU (GPGPU) programming is a pragmatic start towards general heterogeneous reasoning, as GPGPU programming models expose hardware specialization and heterogeneous-aware constructs. In this talk, I discuss my work in this area, which has identified important areas of under-specification in GPGPU programming and laid the foundations for specification repairs. \n\nFirst, I will present work on testing memory consistency models, i.e. the rules governing fine-grained communication, for GPGPUs. This work exposed wide-spread confusion in the GPGPU community, including identifying programming errors in two Nvidia-endorsed textbooks. Second, I will present work on GPGPU forward progress models, which defines a progress abstraction that allows cross-vendor GPGPU global barrier synchronization. This can then be used in an optimization for GPGPU graph traversal applications, achieving over a 10x speedup on Intel and AMD GPUs. The talk concludes by showing that GPGPU reasoning is a natural foundation for future work targeting general heterogeneous programming.\n\nThis lecture satisfies requirements for CSCI 591: Research Colloquium\n\n\nBiography: Tyler Sorensen is a PostDoc at Princeton University in Professor Margaret Martonosi's architecture group working on designing new heterogeneous systems. He received his PhD from Imperial College London under the supervision of Dr. Alastair Donaldson.

        "description": "Speaker: Motahhare Eslami, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n\nTalk Title: Participating and Designing around Algorithmic Sociotechnical Systems\n\nSeries: CS Colloquium\n\nAbstract: Algorithms play a vital role in curating online information in socio-technical systems, however, they are usually housed in black-boxes that limit users' understanding of how an algorithmic decision is made. While this opacity partly stems from protecting intellectual property and preventing malicious users from gaming the system, it is also designed to provide users with seamless, effortless system interactions. However, this opacity can result in misinformed behavior among users, particularly when there is no clear feedback mechanism for users to understand the effects of their own actions on an algorithmic system. The increasing prevalence and power of these opaque algorithms coupled with their sometimes biased and discriminatory decisions raise questions about how knowledgeable users are and should be about the existence, operation and possible impacts of these algorithms. In this talk, I will address these questions by exploring ways to investigate users' behavior around opaque algorithmic systems. I will then present new design techniques that communicate opaque algorithmic processes to users and provide them with a more informed, satisfying, and engaging interaction. In doing so, I will add new angles to the old idea of understanding the interaction between users and automation by designing around algorithm sensemaking and transparency.\n\nThis lecture satisfies requirements for CSCI 591: Research Colloquium\n\n\nBiography: Motahhare Eslami is a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where she is advised by Karrie Karahalios. Motahhare's research develops new communication techniques between users and opaque algorithmic socio-technical systems to provide users a more informed, satisfying, and engaging interaction. Her work has been recognized with a Google PhD Fellowship, Best Paper Award at ACM CHI, and has been covered in mainstream media such as Time, The Washington Post, Huffington Post, the BBC, Fortune, and Quartz. Motahhare is also a Facebook and Adobe PhD fellowship finalist, and a recipient of C.W.

        "description": "Speaker: Chuchu Fan, PhD Candidate, UIUC\n\nTalk Title: Verification and Synthesis Algorithms for Safe Autonomy\n\nAbstract: A single design defect can wreak havoc across thousands of deployed instances of autonomous systems or cyber-physical systems (CPS) such as self-driving cars, drones, and medical devices. Can rigorous approaches based on formal methods and control theory improve safety in autonomous systems by transforming the conventional trial-and-error paradigm? Verification and synthesis for typical models of real-world autonomous systems and CPS are well-known to be hard due to their high dimensionality, nonlinearities, and their nondeterministic and hybrid nature. In this talk, I will present new verification and synthesis algorithms which suggest that these challenges can be overcome and that rigorous approaches are indeed promising. The common ingredient underlying my algorithms is automated sensitivity analysis, which leads to semi-decision procedures for verification and synthesis, with soundness, completeness, and optimality guarantees. I will introduce the first bounded safety verification algorithm for nonlinear hybrid systems. This data-driven algorithm, which is the basis for the C2E2 tool, can also be used for compositional verification of networked and distributed autonomous systems. Then I will present my work on the DryVR framework, which is the first approach that can verify real-world CPS with incomplete or imprecise mathematical models. The final part of my talk will rely on symbolic sensitivity analysis with applications in control synthesis for large linear systems with disturbances. I will discuss successful applications in autonomous driving scenarios, powertrain control, circuits, and medical devices as examples to show the power of these tools for solving challenging problems in a wide range of engineering domains.\n\nBiography: Chuchu Fan is a Ph.D. candidate in the Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. She received her Bachelor's degree from Tsinghua University, Department of Automation in 2013. Her research interests are in the areas of formal methods and control for safe autonomy. She is a recipient of multiple prestigious awards including Mavis Future Faculty Fellowship (2018), Young Researcher for Heidelberg Laureate Forum (2017), Rising Stars in EECS (2016), EMSOFT'16 Best Paper finalist, and Robert Bosch Best Verification Award in CPSWeek'15.

        "description": "Speaker: Jeff Clune, University of Wyoming\n\nTalk Title: Understanding and Improving Deep Neural Networks\n\nSeries: CS Colloquium\n\nAbstract: Through deep learning, deep neural networks have produced state-of-the-art results in a number of different areas of machine learning, including computer vision, natural language processing, robotics and reinforcement learning. I will summarize three projects on better understanding deep neural networks and improving their performance. First I will describe our sustained effort to study how much deep neural networks know about the images they classify. Our team initially showed that deep neural networks are \"easily fooled,\" meaning they will declare with near certainty that completely unrecognizable images are everyday objects. These results suggested that deep neural networks do not truly understand the objects they classify. However, our subsequent results reveal that, when augmented with powerful priors, deep neural networks actually have a surprisingly deep understanding of objects, which also enables them to be incredibly effective generative models that can produce a wide diversity of photo-realistic images. Second, I will summarize our Nature paper on learning algorithms that enable robots, after being damaged, to adapt in 1-2 minutes in order to continue performing their mission. This work combines a novel stochastic optimization algorithm with Bayesian optimization to produce state-of-the-art robot damage recovery. Third, I will describe our recent Go-Explore algorithm, which dramatically improves the ability of deep reinforcement learning algorithms to solve previously unsolvable problems wherein reward signals are sparse, meaning that intelligent exploration is required. Go-Explore solves Montezuma's Revenge, considered by many to be a grand challenge of AI research. I will also very briefly summarize a few other machine learning projects from my career, including our PNAS paper on automatically identifying, counting, and describing wild animals in images taken remotely by motion-sensor cameras. \n\nBiography: Jeff Clune is the Loy and Edith Harris Associate Professor in Computer Science at the University of Wyoming and a Senior Research Manager and founding member of Uber AI Labs, which was formed after Uber acquired a startup he helped lead. Jeff focuses on robotics and training deep neural networks via deep learning, including deep reinforcement learning. Since 2015, a robotics paper he co-authored was on the cover of Nature, a deep learning paper from his lab was on the cover of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, he won an NSF CAREER award, his deep learning papers were awarded honors (best paper awards and/or oral presentations) at the top machine learning conferences (NeurIPS, CVPR, ICLR, and ICML), he was an invited speaker at five ICML and two NeurIPS workshops (including the NeurIPS Deep Reinforcement Learning Workshop), and he was invited to give a forthcoming ICML tutorial. His research is regularly covered in the press, including the New York Times, NPR, NBC, Wired, the BBC, the Economist, Science, Nature, National Geographic, the Atlantic, and the New Scientist. Prior to becoming a professor, he was a Research Scientist at Cornell University and received degrees from Michigan State University (PhD, master's) and the University of Michigan (bachelor's). \n\nHost: Yan Liu",

        "description": "Speaker: Owolabi Legunses, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n\nTalk Title: Evolution-Aware Runtime Verification\n\nSeries: CS Colloquium\n\nAbstract: The risk posed by software bugs has increased significantly as software is now essential to many areas of our daily lives. Runtime verification can help find bugs by monitoring program executions against formally specified properties. Over the last two decades, tremendous research progress has improved the performance of runtime verification. However, there has been very little focus on the benefits and challenges of using runtime verification during software testing. Yet, testing generates many executions on which properties can be monitored.\n\nIn this talk, I will describe my work on studying and improving runtime verification during testing. My large-scale study was the first to show that runtime verification during testing is beneficial for finding many important bugs from tests that developers already have. However, my study also showed that runtime verification still incurs high overhead, both in machine time to monitor properties and in developer time to inspect violations of the properties. Moreover, all prior runtime verification techniques consider only one program version and would wastefully re-monitor unaffected properties and code as software evolves. To reduce the overhead across multiple program versions, I proposed the first evolution-aware runtime verification techniques. My techniques exploit the key insight that software evolves in small increments and reduce the accumulated runtime verification overhead by up to 10x, without missing new violations.\n\nThis lecture satisfies requirements for CSCI 591: Research Colloquium\n\nBiography: Owolabi Legunsen is a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he works with Darko Marinov and Grigore Rosu. Owolabi's interests are in Software Engineering and Applied Formal Methods, with a focus on Software Testing and Runtime Verification. His research goal is to improve software reliability by helping developers find more bugs, find bugs faster, and find bugs more reliably. So far, his techniques and tools helped find more than 450 bugs in over 90 open-source projects. His research on runtime verification during software testing received an ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award at ASE 2016.

This talk presents recent results that exploit the interplay between them. Viewing Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithms as performing an optimization over the space of probability distributions, we demonstrate analogs of Nesterov's acceleration approach in the sampling domain, in the form of a discretization of an underdamped Langevin diffusion. In the other direction, we view stochastic gradient optimization methods, such as those that are common in deep learning, as sampling algorithms, and study the finite-time convergence of their iterates to an invariant distribution.\n\nJoint work with Xiang Cheng, Niladri S.

The answer to the problem can be computed by solving an associated Dynamic Programming (DP) problem.  Unfortunately, the DP paradigm is also synonymous with the infamous  \"Curse of Dimensionality (COD)\", a phrase coined by the discoverer of the Dynamic Programming paradigm, Richard Bellman, nearly 60 years ago, to capture the fact that the computational complexity of solving a DP problem grows exponentially in the dimension of the state space of the problem.\n\nIn this talk, we will introduce a newly discovered paradigm in stochastic optimal control, called Decoupling, that allows us to separate the design of the open and closed loops of a stochastic optimal control problem with continuous control space. This \"Decoupled\" solution allows us to break the COD inherent in DP problems, while remaining near-optimal, to third order, to the true stochastic control. The implications of the Decoupled design are examined in the context of Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). We shall introduce two algorithms, called the Trajectory Optimized Perturbation Feedback Control (T-PFC), and the Decoupled Data based Control(D2C), for the MPC and RL problems respectively.  We shall also examine the consequences of the decoupling principle in partially observed/ belief space planning problems and present the Trajectory optimized Linear Quadratic Gaussian (T-LQG) algorithm.\n\nBiography: Suman Chakravorty obtained his B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering in 1997 from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras and his PhD in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2004. From August 2004- August 2010, he was an Assistant Professor with the Aerospace Engineering Department at Texas A&M University, College Station and since August 2010, he has been an Associate Professor in the department. Dr. Chakravorty's broad research interests lie in the estimation and control of stochastic dynamical systems with application to autonomous, distributed robotic mapping and planning, and situational awareness problems. He is a member of AIAA, ASME and IEEE. He is an Associate Editor for the ASME Journal on Dynamical Systems, Measurement and Control and the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters.\n\nHost: Mihailo Jovanovic",

However, these methods are very sensitive to selecting optimal hyperparameters. Frequently this is done by large scale experimentation often through grid or random searches. However, this is computationally expensive and time consuming. In this talk, I will present a few methods for learning hyperparameters during the training process. Thus, instead of training multiple networks with different hyperparameters, we only need to train one network without large grid search experiments. Our methods yield comparable, and often better, results, but at a faster experimentation rate.\n\n\nBiography: Kenton Murray is a 5th year PhD Candidate at the University of Notre Dame working with David Chiang on methods for improving Neural Machine Translation for Low Resource and Morphologically Rich Language Pairs.

This opens new opportunities to explore cyber robotics algorithms (sensors and human motor plant) and smart manufacturing algorithms (sensors and manufacturing equipment). These algorithms process motion sensor data and provide situation awareness for a wide range of applications. Smart management and training systems assist humans in day-to-day living routines, healthcare and sports. Machines benefit from smart monitoring in manufacturing, retail machinery, transportation, and construction safety. During my PhD Research, I have developed several approaches for motion analysis and classification. (1) A situation awareness system (SAS) for head-mounted smartphones to respond to user activities (e.g., disable incoming phone calls in elevators, activate video recording while car driving), (2) a filter for head-mounted sensors (HOS) to allow full-body motion capturing by removing interfering head-motions, (3) an Inertial Machine Monitoring System (IMMS) to detect equipment failure or degraded states of a 3D-Printer, and (4) a \"Smart Teaching System\" (STS) for targeted motion feedback to refine physical tasks. To capture real-world sensor data, we designed hardware prototypes or used state-of-the-art wearable technology. We developed novel sensor fusion algorithms, implemented feature extraction methods based on gist, statistics, physics, frequency diagrams and validated classifiers: SAS achieved high accuracy (81.5%) when distinguishing between 20 real-world activities. HOS reduced the positional error of a traveled distance below 2.5 % with head-mounted sensors for pedestrian dead reckoning applications. IMMS yielded 11-way classification accuracy over 99% when distinguishing between normal operation vs. 10 types of real-world abnormal equipment behavior. STS demonstrated that combining motion sensors and provide targeted feedback yield significantly improved golf swing training (3.7x increased performance score).",

Fimbres Weihs, PhD, CONACYT Research Fellow - ITSON, Dept. of Water & Environmental Sciences, Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Sonora\n\nTalk Title: Reducing the impacts of biofouling in RO through membrane modifications and hydrodynamics -\u201c Dealing with water scarcity in Sonora, Mexico\n\nAbstract: Water scarcity affects many regions of the world that already face issues with water supply. The state of Sonora, Mexico, is constantly afflicted by physical water scarcity, and this has led to social conflict in recent years. This work summarizes recent results of the CONACyT Fellowship Research Project at ITSON, which aims to improve the understanding of reverse osmosis membrane biofouling, specifically for the Pacific coast of Mexico, and develop strategies for reducing its impact on seawater desalination. Both experimental and numerical (CFD) efforts are underway. Through the analysis of the microbiological composition and seasonal variability of water from the Sea of Cortez, native seawater bacterium strain (Bacillus halotolerans MCC1) has been isolated and used for accelerated biofouling experiments. The suitability of iron nanoparticles (FeNPs) and graphene oxide (GO) for reducing biofouling has been tested. CFD simulations have been performed to test forced transient flow techniques for improving mass transfers in membrane modules, and for designing novel spacer geometries through 3D printing techniques. Moreover, the use of solar energy for desalination is being assessed and optimized. By means of this multi-prong approach, the aim is to reduce costs and make RO desalination an accessible technology for dealing with water scarcity in Sonora.\n\nBiography: Dr. Gustavo Fimbres Weihs received his B.Eng. in Chemical and Systems Engineering in 2002 from Monterrey Tech, Campus Monterrey, and his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering in 2008 from the University of New South Wales (UNSW), in Sydney, Australia, at the UNESCO Membrane Science and Technology Center. During his doctoral work he used numerical simulations of fluid dynamics (CFD) to analyze the flows within the membrane modules that are used for water treatment and desalination. He also worked on a desalination linkage project between the University of New South Wales and the European Union, as part of Framework Programme 6. From 2009 to 2014 he worked as a researcher for the Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies (CO2CRC) in Australia, where he led the research into CO2 Transport Networks and co-led the development of a techno-economic model for the analysis of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) projects. He has collaborated on consultancy and feasibility studies conducted by CO2CRC. He is currently a CONACYT Research Fellow at the Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Sonora (ITSON), where he leads collaborative research projects dealing with RO membrane biofouling (IHE-Delft), membrane modifications, solar energy use for desalination (CSIR-CSMCRI India) and CFD modelling of the hydrodynamics in membrane modules (UMP Malaysia). He is a board member of the Mexican Society of Membrane Science and Technology\n\nHost: Dr. Amy Childress",

        "description": "Speaker: Varun Jog, Assistant Professor, University of Wisconsin-Madison\n\nTalk Title: Analyzing Learning Algorithms: Perspectives from Information Theory and Optimal Transport\n\nAbstract: In this talk, we will analyze generalization and robustness properties of learning algorithms using tools derived from information theory and optimal transport. In statistical learning theory, generalization error is used to quantify the degree to which a supervised machine learning algorithm may overfit to training data. Leveraging recent work [Xu and Raginsky (2017)], we derive information-theoretic generalization error bounds for a broad class of iterative algorithms that are characterized by bounded, noisy updates with Markovian structure, such as stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD). We describe certain shortcomings of these information-theoretic bounds, and propose alternate strategies that rely on optimal transport theory. We show that results from optimal transport are well-suited to analyze not only generalization properties, but also robustness properties of learning algorithms.\n\nBiography: Varun Jog received his B.Tech. degree in Electrical Engineering from IIT Bombay in 2010, and his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) from UC Berkeley in 2015.

        "description": "Speaker: F. Duncan Haldane, Princeton University\n\nTalk Title: Topological Quantum Matter, Entanglement, and the Second Quantum Revolution\n\nAbstract: While the laws of quantum mechanics have remained unchanged and always validated for the last eighty-five years, new discoveries about the exotic states that they allow, entanglement, and ideas from quantum information theory have greatly changed our perspective, so much so that some talk of a \"second quantum revolution\" that is currently underway. The discovery of unexpected \"topological states of matter\", and their possible use for \"topologically-protected quantum information processing\" is one of the important themes of these developments, and will be reviewed. Some of the early work in the 1980's that began to expose topological quantum matter has already earned Nobel Prizes, including the experimental discoveries of von Klitzing (Integer Quantum Hall Effect, Nobel 1985), and Stormer and Tsui (Fractional Quantum Hall Effect, Nobel 1998), the theoretical discovery of its description by Laughlin (co-laureate, 1998), and the work honored by the recent 2016 prize, which also occured in the 1980's. Given the surprising nature of subsequent recent developments, and the excitement they have generated, it seems likely that more will follow, especially if the current attempts to demonstrate \"braiding\" become successful. It is no exaggeration to say that, at least in Condensed Matter Physics, the concepts and language used to describe quantum states of matter have dramatically changed since about 1980 as a result of all these developments, in which the quantum property of \"entanglement\" plays a key role.\n\nBiography: Duncan Haldane, who shared the 2016 Nobel Prize for Physics with David Thouless and Michael Kosterlitz, is the Sherman Fairchild University Professor of Physics at Princeton University, a Fellow of the Royal Society of London, and a Foreign Associate of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. He is also a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Physical Society, and the Institute of Physics (UK).\nHe was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize for his theoretical work on \"topological states of matter\", including pioneering\nwork on unexpected (and initially controversial) \"topological quantum states\" of one-dimensional systems of magnetic atoms (for which he had previously received the 1993 Oliver Buckley Prize of the American Physical Society), and on the 1988 theoretical prediction of (ferromagnetic) topological insulators exhibiting the \"quantum anomalous Hall effect\" (finally observed experimentally many years later in 2013) for which he shared the 2012 Dirac medal of the International\nCenter for Theoretical Physics (Trieste) with Charles Kane and Shou-Cheng Zhang. His work helped to open up new directions and ways of thinking about quantum effects in condensed matter, and in recent years, \"topological quantum matter\" has grown into a very active experimental field which many believe may provide platforms for \"quantum computing\". He also initiated the field of \"topological photonics\". He currently works on \"quantum geometry\" in the \"fractional quantum Hall effect\".\nDr. Haldane received his Ph. D. in theoretical condensed matter physics from Cambridge University, under the direction\nand mentorship of Philip W. Anderson (Nobel Laureate in Physics 1977), and, before his appointment at Princeton University, worked at the Institut Laue-Langevin (Grenoble, France), the University of Southern California, Bell Laboratories, and the University of California, San Diego. Haldane was born in London in 1951, of mixed Scottish and Slovenian origins. Despite also having three forenames, he is unrelated to the famous biologist J. B. S. Haldane.\n\nHost: ECE-Electrophysics\n\nMore Info: https://minghsiehee.usc.edu/about/lectures/munushian/",

It has enabled the interconnection of objects and data to provide novel services that are changing the landscape of cities and communities worldwide.  The impact of these technologies are being felt when they improve and enrich the basic elements of our daily lives in our homes and workplaces.  During large scale disasters and unexpected events such as (fires, floods and earthquakes), these technologies can be morphed to gain improved situational awareness and better decision support for response personnel, agencies and citizens.  The ability to ensure resilient operation under small events and large disasters requires intelligent data collection and data exchange from diverse devices and data sources and interpretation of this information for higher level semantic observations.  Drawing on our recent efforts in smartspaces, smart firefighting and smartwater infrastructures , I will discuss the role of adaptive middleware and big data technologies to generate situational awareness.  The ability to combine novel technologies at multiple layers will open up new possibilities for resilient and scalable communities of the future. \n\nBiography: Nalini Venkatasubramanian is currently a Professor in the School of Information and Computer Science at the University of California Irvine. She has had significant research and industry experience in the areas of distributed systems, adaptive middleware, pervasive and mobile computing, cyberphysical systems, distributed multimedia and formal methods and has over 250 publications in these areas. As a key member of the Center for Emergency Response Technologies at UC Irvine, Nalini's recent research has focused on enabling resilient and sustainable communities using IoT/CPS technologies. In particular, her research addresses scalable observation and analysis of situational information from multimodal input sources; dynamic adaptation of the underlying systems to enable information flow under massive failures and the dissemination of  rich notifications to members of the public at large.  She is the recipient of the prestigious NSF Career Award, multiple Undergraduate Teaching Excellence Awards and best paper awards. Prof. Venkatasubramanian has served in numerous program and organizing committees of conferences on middleware, distributed systems and multimedia and on the editorial boards of journals. She received and M.S and Ph.D in Computer Science from the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. Her research is supported both by government and industrial sources such  as  NSF, DHS, ONR, DARPA, Novell, Hewlett-Packard and Nokia.  Prior to arriving at UC Irvine, Nalini was a Research Staff Member at the Hewlett-Packard Laboratories in Palo Alto, California.\n\nHost: Paul Bogdan",
